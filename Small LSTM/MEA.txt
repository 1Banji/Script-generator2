PLANETSIDE

ACT I
 

SCENE I
BRIEFING
 

[Ryder, Liam and Cora joins Captain Dunn on the Hyperion bridge as the Hyperion prepares to dock at the Nexus.]

 

CAPTAIN DUNN:

Ryder, good to see you on your feet. We’re at the Nexus. It’s the forward hub for the entire Andromeda Initiative. The asari, salarian, and turian arks should be there, too.

 

[The Hyperion is flying toward the Nexus, which can be seen from afar.]

 

RYDER:

Let’s hope they’ve had better luck.

 

LANI:

Starting our approach now.

 

LIAM:

It’s almost as big as the Citadel back home.

 

LANI:

Nexus control, this is Ark Hyperion requesting docking clearance.

 

[The Nexus can be seen from up close. The Hyperion seems incredibly small compared to it.]

 

LANI:

Captain, I’m only getting their automated approach channel, not a live person.

 

CAPTAIN DUNN:

Well, like it or not, we’re here. Take us in.

 

[They all watch as the Hyperion docks. The Nexus appears to be under construction, with large parts of it not built.]

 

CORA:

Construction should’ve been finished by now.

 

LIAM:

Could be worse…

 

RYDER:

How? Habitat 7’s a bust, we might’ve started a war with the first aliens we met, and our Pathfinder’s dead. This better be rock bottom.

 

LANI:

Green across the board. Docking initiated.

 

[The Hyperion finishes docking.]

 

CAPTAIN DUNN:

All right. I got us here. Good luck, Pathfinder.

 

[Ryder, Cora, and Liam leave the Bridge.]

 

CORA:

You going to be okay, Ryder?

 

RYDER:

The Captain just called me "Pathfinder." This is really happening.

 

LIAM:

Just take a deep breath.

 

RYDER:

I still can't believe Dad's dead. This should've been his moment.

 

CORA:

But now it's yours. You just need to decide what you're going to do with it.

 

RYDER:

Where do I start? I'm just not sure I'm ready.

 

LIAM:

We weren't ready to fall out of the sky on Habitat 7. But we survived that.

 

RYDER:

Right. So, always keep a jump-jet handy.

 

[Ryder, Cora, and Liam walk away from the bridge. Two crew members are talking in front of a console.]

 

CREW 1:

I need engineering to secure all connections from the ark to the Nexus.

 

 

CREW 2:

What's the priority?

 

CREW 1:

Start running power and data links first. Then move to secondary comm traffic.

 

CREW 2:

Got it. I'll follow up with their engineers later.

 

[They reach the next room.]

 

CREW 1:

Captain wants to see a full duty roster.

 

CREW 2:

I just updated the charts.

 

CREW 1:

She'll want to see crew reassignments first. Start with non-essential personnel.

 

[They’re close to the tram. A man is addressing crew members outside. Ryder pauses to listen.]

 

CREW 1:

Okay folks, this is what we've been waiting for. Let your teams know that docking procedures are now in effect. We've got 20.000 colonists still asleep, and we'll need somewhere to put them when the alarm clock goes off. As soon as we get clearance from the Nexus, we'll be following statis revival protocols. We want to avoid any log jams, so it's vital your teams coordinate with each other and keep people moving. Any questions so far?

 

CREW 2:

How do we handle deaths that occurred in transit?

 

CREW 1:

Right. It's an unfortunate fact that not everyone will have survived the voyage. We've already got scattered reports of medical problems from that dark energy cloud we hit. If somebody didn't make it, check with the medical officer. We'll see about notifying their next of kin. I'm hoping it's a rare exception. Also, try to keep it quiet. Andromeda is all about new beginnings, not holding funerals.

 

[Ryder, Liam, and Cora board the tram.]

 

 

SCENE II
Entering the Nexus
 

[The tram is on its way to the Nexus.]

 

RYDER (VOICE-OVER):

It'll be nice to see some friendly faces this time.

 

CORA (VOICE-OVER):

The Nexus runs a support crew. Just enough to finish building the station and provide safe harbor for the arks.

 

[Inside the tram, Cora and Liam are on either side of the tram’s door. Cora is using her omni-tool.]

 

RYDER:

Means we can start waking our people up.

 

LIAM:

They built a bar, right? Gotta have champagne for the welcome party.

 

RYDER:

You're expecting one?

 

LIAM:

After what we've been through, I could use a buzz.

 

RYDER:

We all could.

 

LIAM:

Yeah. Rough ride so far.

 

CORA:

We'll bounce back. Real food and a shower are just ahead.

 

[The tram stops and the door opens to the Nexus’ Common Area.]

 

CORA:

Here we are.

 

[They step out of the tram and enter the Common Area. It’s dark and appears empty.]

 

LIAM:

Uh... I don't see any champagne.

 

RYDER:

Where is everybody? Well, this can't be right.

 

CORA:

It's like everything's on standby.

 

LIAM:

If it's a surprise party, they're doing an awfully good job of it.

 

[Plants are in the middle of the area in a sublevel platform. In front of them is Avina, an asari-looking VI emitting a faint blue light.]

 

RYDER:

Plants are still alive.

 

CORA:

We could see what the VI has to say.

 

[Ryder activates Avina.]

 

AVINA:

Welcome to the Nexus, gateway to Andromeda. I'm Avina, a virtual intelligence designed to assist you with immigration.

 

LIAM:

Can you tell us where the welcome party is hiding?

 

AVINA:

I'm sorry. My code is limited to information and simple interaction simulations. Please select from the following pre-programmed responses.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Immigration

-Andromeda Galaxy

-The Nexus

-Living arrangements

-Current year

 

RYDER:

How does the immigration process work?

 

AVINA:

We ask that you submit to a brief medical exam to ensure your health and well-being after making such a long journey. Once you've been cleared, our colonization experts will assist you in finding your new home. Please be mindful of the queue: thousands of eager colonists like you are waiting to begin their new life in Andromeda!

 

LIAM:

Uh... where? Place is deserted.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Immigration

-Andromeda Galaxy

-The Nexus

-Living arrangements

-Current year

 

RYDER:

What can you tell me about the Andromeda Galaxy?

 

AVINA:

Here in Andromeda, you are over two million-light years away from the Milky Way Galaxy. This is the furthest any lifeform has ever traveled outside our home system, making you a brave pioneer, indeed. The Nexus itself is located in a region known as the Heleus Cluster. Here, you and thousands of your fellow colonists will fulfill your dreams of settling a new home. Fortune awaits!

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Immigration

-Andromeda Galaxy

-The Nexus

-Living arrangements

-Current year

 

RYDER:

What is the Nexus?

 

AVINA:

The Nexus serves as the central hub for the Andromeda Initiative's colonization efforts. It is the first destination for all colonists upon their arrival in the new galaxy. Please enjoy the many venues the Nexus has to offer. As  the station expands, it will one day serve as the seat of government for Milky Way colonists. Providing a safe, stable and prosperous environment is our primary goal.

 

CORA:

Not from the looks of it.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Immigration

-Andromeda Galaxy

-The Nexus

-Living arrangements

-Current year

 

 

RYDER:

Where do colonists live?

 

AVINA:

Once you've cleared immigration, our helpful staff will assist you in choosing the homeworld of your dreams. Will it be the tropical paradise of Habitat 7? The gentle rolling hills of Habitat 3? Or perhaps the mysterious twilight world of Habitat 5? Whichever you choose, rest assured our Pathfinders have carefully vetted all colony worlds to ensure your security and prosperity.

 

RYDER:

Oh, boy.

 

LIAM:

Habitat 7? That's where we landed. She's way out of date.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Immigration

-Andromeda Galaxy

-The Nexus

-Living arrangements

-Current year

 

RYDER:

What year is it?

 

AVINA:

The current year is 2819. After spending 600 years in stasis, it's normal to feel disoriented or confused upon arrival. Our helpful medical staff can assist with any physical or psychological aftereffects you may be experiencing.

 

CORA:

Well, she's got the date right, at least.

 

RYDER:

So where is everyone?

 

[Ryder logs off.]

 

RYDER:

That's all.

 

AVINA:

It has been my pleasure. Please see one of our helpful immigration staff for further assistance. And welcome to our new home in Andromeda, where the brightest star is you! Current wait time for immigration processing is: UNKNOWN ERROR.

 

 

CORA:

Right. That was helpful.

 

[Ryder, Cora and Liam stare at the area.]

 

CORA:

It's like they didn't finish building it.

 

LIAM:

Hello?

 

RYDER:

This place should be packed with people.

 

[They walk down to reach the sub-platform. That’s when they see a Nexus construction worker.]

 

LIAM:

There's a guy. Maybe he's got champagne.

 

CORA:

Let's talk to that worker.

 

[They walk over to him.]

 

RYDER:

Hi, there.

 

[The construction worker gets up and turns around.]

 

RYDER:

We're from Ark Hyperion. And wondering where everybody went...?

 

[The construction worker looks shocked. He opens his mouth but no sounds come out. Ryder and Liam look at each other.]

 

LIAM:

Did he hear you?

 

WORKER:

Did you say an "ark"?

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

CASUAL -Is that a problem?

PROFESSIONAL -I did.

 

RYDER:

Yeah, we just got in.

 

CORA:

And for what it's worth, your VI over there could use an update.

 

WORKER:

But... we thought you were all dead!

 

[Cora looks shocked.]

 

CORA:

What?

 

WORKER:

Or captured. Or lost in dark space, or... But you're here. You have no idea how much this means.

 

KANDROS:

I don't believe it...

 

[Kandros, a turian, walks toward them.]

 

KANDROS:

I'm Tiran Kandros. I lead our militia on the Nexus.

 

[Ryder and Kandros shake hands.]

 

RYDER:

I'm Scott Ryder. This is Cora Harper and Liam Kosta, part of the Pathfinder team.

 

KANDROS:

I'm sorry for the confusion. Our sensors told us an ark had arrived, but Heleus is notorious for scrambling equipment. We thought you were just another malfuction.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -We're definitely here.

LOGICAL -Why is that?

 

RYDER:

But aren't you expecting us?

 

KANDROS:

You're the first ark we've seen. After a year of waiting and no sign of the others, we shuttered this area and stopped looking.

 

LIAM:

You've been stranded for a whole year?

 

 

KANDROS:

Longer. I'll fill you in on the way to Ops Center.

 

SCENE III
Going to Nexus Operations
 

[Kandros walks toward the tram. The Pathfinder team follows him.]

 

KANDROS:

Everything that could go wrong with our plan, has. We arrived fourteen months ago. Right away we hit a band of dark energy that knocked us off course.

 

RYDER:

We're familiar with it.

 

KANDROS:

Then you'll know why we call it the "Scourge." We lost whole sections of the station. A lot of people died. No power, no food... the chaos went on for months. It finally led to armed rebellion. When order was restored, the insurgents were banished. "Exiles," we call them.

 

CORA:

Are things back to normal?

 

KANDROS:

Not even close. But you're here now, so maybe the worst is over.  Ryder, we should get to the tram. A lot of people will want to see you.

 

[Ryder, Liam, Cora, and Kandros use the tram to reach Nexus Operations.]

 

CORA:

No word from other Pathfinders?

 

KANDROS:

No word from anyone, period.

 

LIAM:

Any threats from the locals?

 

KANDROS:

So far, we've stayed hidden. We're in no shape to deal with an attack.

 

RYDER:

We had a first contact situation on Habitat 7. Whole thing went south. They tried to kill us.

 

 

KANDROS:

That wasn't first contact—we know about them. Those aliens are going to be  a real problem.

 

CORA:

This day just keeps getting better.

 

KANDROS:

We're here.

 

ACT II
 

SCENE I
Meeting the Nexus Leadership
 

[Ryder, Liam, Cora, and Kandros exit the tram. Liam walks ahead.]

 

LIAM:

You guys go ahead. I'll check out the security situation.

 

[Kandros leads Cora and Ryder to the left. They walk up a ramp the next floor.]

 

KANDROS:

You should know our command structure has been fractured. Some of us are filling in for leaders who died.

 

[Two crew members rush past them.]

 

CREW 1:

Is it true?

 

CREW 2:

They said drop everything and report for duty.

 

[They keep walking.]

 

KANDROS:

... and no one was expecting an ark to finally show up.

 

[On the bridge, which can be reached by walking up some stairs, several crew members are standing in front of consoles.]

 

 

CREW:

Docking procedures are green across the board.

 

CREW 2:

Stand by to merge Hyperion power into the grid.

 

[As Kandros leads Cora and Ryder to the bridge, everyone stops working and stares. Three figures are seen closer than the others: a female human, a male salarian, and a female krogan. The male salarian walks toward them, watched by the human and the krogan.]

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

The crew of the Hyperion...

 

KANDROS:

Good luck.

 

[Kandros pats Ryder on the shoulder and leaves. Director Tann is now facing Ryder and Cora.]

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

I'm Jarun Tann, Director of the Initiative. You have no idea how much your arrival means to us.

 

[As he talks, the human woman who had been standing with Tann joins him.]

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -It means more to us.

LOGICAL -We’re here to assist. 

 

RYDER:

We've heard about what happened, and we're ready to help.

 

ADDISON:

We could use any supplies you have—food, water—we're short on everything.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

This is Foster Addison. She oversees Colonial Affairs.

 

[Tann looks at them, a bit surprised.]

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

Where's the Pathfinder?

 

RYDER:

You're looking at him.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

You're not Alec Ryder.

 

RYDER:

My father's dead. He made me his successor.

 

[Ryder looks sad. Addison looks sad as well.]

 

ADDISON:

Alec... is dead?

 

[Ryder lowers his eyes.]

 

ADDISON:

Please understand: the entire Initiative is at risk.

 

[She directs the entire group to look at a screen full of data.]

 

ADDISON:

None of the golden worlds have panned out. They're a bust. And there's been no word from the other arks.

 

CORA:

What happened to them?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

Unknown. Our supplies are nearly depleted. Rationing bought us some time, but even that's running out.

 

ADDISON:

We need to find more resources. But that takes people, and we can't wake them up—

 

RYDER:

—until they have somewhere to live. A golden world.

 

ADDISON:

Now more than ever, we need a Pathfinder.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

It now falls to you, Ryder. Are you up to the task?

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -I am.

LOGICAL -My father thought so.

CASUAL -Let’s hope so.

PROFESSIONAL -You don’t have a choice.

 

RYDER:

My father believed I am. If you trusted him with the job, you'll have to trust his judgment.

 

ADDISON:

Your father won't be around to fix things if you fail.

 

KESH:

That's no way to treat a guest.

 

[The female krogan from before joins the group.]

 

RYDER:

My father believed I am. If you trusted him with the job, you'll have to trust his judgment.

 

ADDISON:

Your father won't be around to fix things if you fail.

 

KESH:

I'm Nakmor Kesh, superintendent of this station. I hope they haven't scared you off already.

 

ADDISON:

It's nothing personal. But now isn't the time for on-the-job training.

 

KESH:

At least the Pathfinder here seems willing to try. We could use a fresh perspective.

 

[Addison and Kesh face each other.]

 

ADDISON:

You've heard my concerns. I'll leave you to it.

 

[Addison brushes past Kesh who looks at her leaving.]

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

We're all feeling the pressure. Let's have a private word in my office, Ryder. We'll discuss giving you a scout ship. I'm happy to work out the details with your associate?

 

[Tann points to Cora and leaves. Cora gives Ryder a pointed look before joining Tann. Kesh and Ryder are now alone.]

 

KESH:

Welcome to the Nexus.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -Thanks for helping.

LOGICAL -It’s a mess.

 

RYDER:

Thank you for standing up for me there.

 

 

KESH:

Hope's in short supply here. What little we can find should have a chance to bloom.

 

[A crew member interrupts them.]

 

CREW:

Ma'am, the Hyperion's core is now online.

 

[Kesh looks at Ryder.]

 

KESH:

Let me show you something.

 

[Kesh leads Ryder to the bridge’s central console.]

 

KESH:

An hour ago, that was all dark. But with the power from your ship—you're keeping the lights on. You have my vote.

 

[As she talks, lights appear on the bridge through the large windows which are no longer covered. It illuminates Ryder’s face, who watches, pensive. After a second, he turns to Kesh.]

 

RYDER:

And when the power runs out?

 

KESH:

You'd best go talk to Director Tann. Make sure that doesn't happen.

 

[She leaves, still talking to Ryder.]

 

KESH:

And don't be shy—come see me when you have a chance.

 

[The windows of the bridge are fully uncovered. Through them, Ryder can see the rest of the Nexus, still under construction. He’s at the center of the bridge, facing away.]

 

-> Additional scenes I

 

[Ryder walks toward a console on his left. A woman, the operations manager, is standing in front of it and talking to someone on her comm.]

 

OPERATIONS MANAGER:

Taila, where's Vetra at? The Hyperion is starting to send a tally of supplies. Handling something big, is she? I'll just organize this as it comes in and send it your way. You know what the priority needs are, anyway. Thank you.

 

[A salarian technician is using his omni-tool next to her and looking at the console.]

 

TECHNICIAN:

Hello, console. You and I are going to be very good friends. We'll get you all fixed up and ready to go in no time. As soon as we hook you up to all that juicy, juicy power.

 

OPERATIONS MANAGER;

Hmm, power couplers, more power relays, excellent. What... Girl Scout cookies. Hyperion's inventory lists Galactic Scout Cookies.

 

TECHNICIAN:

Wait, really? Seriously? I want those.

 

OPERATIONS MANAGER;

You'll have to fight Kesh for the Galaxy Swirls.

 

TECHNICIAN:

I don't care. It'll be worth it.

 

[A platform on the Nexus bridge is where Addison’s open office can be found. Addison is talking to someone on the comm. There is another man there, also talking on comm.]

 

NEXUS CONTROL:

This is Nexus Control to Hyperion. It's good to have you here.

 

LANI (COMM):

It's good to be here.

 

NEXUS CONTROL:

Excellent. Let's go over the docking checklist, shall we?

 

[Ryder gets closer to Addison and can hear her conversation.]

 

ADDISON (ON COMM):

No, it isn't what we wanted, but what choice do we have?—How the hell should I know? Spender, you have a job. If you want to keep it, do it. Goddamn it.

 

[Ryder hears an announcement on the Bridge: “Please be advised that Hyperion docking procedures are now complete.” He walks toward Addison. She crosses her arms when she sees him.]

 

ADDISON:

All right. What happened?

 

RYDER:

To who?

 

 

ADDISON:

"To whom," and your goddamn father.

 

[Ryder stares at her, disapproving. Addison puts a hand on her face.]

 

ADDISON:

Sorry, my face is tired from dealing with... everything. And right now, I just want to know what happened with Alec.

 

[She crosses her arms again.]

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -He wanted me to be Pathfinder.

LOGICAL -All that matters is he’s gone.

 

RYDER:

In the moment, it saved my life. But it seems my father meant for me to get the role eventually.

 

ADDISON:

It isn't hereditary. If we wanted an inbred monarchy, we could've left half our gene stock back home.

 

[Addison sighs.]

 

ADDISON:

Not "home." The Milky Way? This is home. This... mess. We don't have a lot of options, Ryder. Maybe you'll prove your father right. After fourteen months of failed colonization, forgive me if I don't hold my breath.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Colonial Director position

-Relationship with my father

-The plan for the hostiles

-Insight into strange tech

-Failing outposts

 

RYDER:

How do you fit into the Nexus leadership?

 

ADDISON:

I oversee the actual settlement effort. As the number of outposts is currently less than ideal, my influence is limited. As Tann is quick to remind me. Left a perfectly adequate career as a chief officer. Provincial capital, too. Only a new galaxy could pull me away. And here we are. Idling.

 

 

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Colonial Director position

-Relationship with my father

-The plan for the hostiles

-Insight into strange tech

-Failing outposts

 

RYDER:

You called my father Alec. No one does that.

 

ADDISON:

A lot of us joined the Initiative because of his vision. What he shared of it, anyway.

 

RYDER:

Were you friends, or...?

 

ADDISON:

I'm not your new mother, if that's what you're asking. Or his friend. He hated that I didn't use his title. But no one's a Pathfinder until they've pathfound something. Much like a Colonial Director without colonies.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Colonial Director position

-Relationship with my father

-The plan for the hostiles

-Insight into strange tech

-Failing outposts

 

RYDER:

There must be some kind of plan for encountering hostile aliens. We can't have been that naive.

 

ADDISON:

We expected life, not an enemy that refuses to talk. They don't attack—they disinfect. We're nothing until we're bacteria. Sorry. Fourteen months and you stoop to poetry. That's how bad it is. Not sure who started it, but we're calling them "kett." Kandros will know more. Maybe too much.

 

RYDER:

You don't trust him?

 

ADDISON:

I trust him to defend us. I do not trust a rising military influence in a supposedly civilian Initiative. We came here to make history, Ryder. Not repeat it. Ugh. Goddamn poetry.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Colonial Director position

-Relationship with my father

-The plan for the hostiles

-Insight into strange tech

-Failing outposts

 

RYDER:

There's also the strange technology? Has anyone studied that?

 

ADDISON:

We've tried. Not me—the brains in research. They're supposed to know their business. The current excuse? The tech we dug up on Mars was more advanced, but it was plug-and-go. The tech here... thinks different? I don't know. We've mostly avoided it. And from what the Hyperion logs say about Alec, maybe that's good.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Colonial Director position

-Relationship with my father

-The plan for the hostiles

-Insight into strange tech

-Failing outposts

 

RYDER:

You've had no colony successes in over a year? How many tries is that?

 

ADDISON:

Less than you'd think. The Scourge, spoiled worlds, exiles, hostiles... We can't just plop down an outpost and expect picket fences. We need the Pathfinder and SAM to scout, evaluate... and inspire. The Initiative promised a goal. Andromeda has not cooperated.

 

RYDER:

And if it had?

 

ADDISON:

Beautiful utopian horse shit. Colonies that produce and support each other. The Nexus as Citadel—not headed by Tann. Or even me.

 

RYDER:

Excuse me, Director Addison.

 

ADDISON:

Ryder...

 

RYDER:

It's "Pathfinder."

 

[Addison moves closer to Ryder until their faces are mere centimeters apart.]

 

 

 

ADDISON:

Ryder, we're starving here. If we don't get a foundation of outposts to feed the Initiative, we might as well be 600-years dead. Alec promised a lot. None of it panned out. That's what you're up against. Why people won't trust you. Why I don't trust you. Prove me wrong.

 

[Ryder walks down the stairs. On the far right of Nexus Operations is Kesh’s office. Ryder enters it. She’s on the comm with various people.]

 

KESH (COMM):

Yes, I know the Hyperion docking unannounced caused some switches to blow. That's fine.

(...)

I don't care. We know the problem is more widespread than we thought. We're working to fix it. That's all.

(...)

My crew's working on it. We've moved the ops center to the top of our priority list.

(...)

That's an entire sector showing green. Good job, you two.

(...)

I'll check it out myself as soon as I have a moment. Move on to the docks for now.

 

[Kesh notices Ryder.]

 

KESH:

There you are. Hope the others haven't been giving you a hard time. There's a lot that needs doing. At least with the Hyperion hooked up and feeding us power, my team and I can get more work done.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Krogan whereabouts

-Nexus problems

-The genophage

-Your job

 

RYDER:

I noticed there aren't a lot of krogan around?

 

KESH:

You haven't spoken to Number Eight yet, have you?

 

RYDER:

Number Eight?

 

KESH:

Tann. Ask him why most of my people left. He'll have opinions. I can tell you this much. When the mutiny happened, a deal was made. My clan was supposed to settle matters and, in return, get more say in the Initiative.

 

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Number Eight

-Krogan deal with Tann

 

RYDER:

Why do you call Tann "Eight"?

 

KESH:

Because he was eighth in line to take over the Andromeda Initiative. I like to remind him of that now and then. Keep him... humble.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Number Eight

-Krogan deal with Tann

 

RYDER:

Did the deal go through?

 

KESH:

The clan held up their part, but Tann had a meltdown when he found   out we wanted more say around here. Then Addison's assistant, Spender, pretended he never made the deal in the first place. It was a mess, but I don't blame my people for walking out. We're done being used.

 

RYDER:

With your clan gone... why did you stay?

 

KESH:

It's... complicated. The station and my clan both need me here.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Krogan whereabouts

-Nexus problems

-The genophage

-Your job

 

RYDER:

What sort of problems have you seen on the Nexus?

 

KESH:

"Situation's gone to shit" pretty much sums it up. There's arks missing. Some idiots tried to mutiny and take over, then more idiots offended my clan, so they left. And to top it all off, the founder of the Initiative, Jien Garson, was killed.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Jien Garson

-More about Nexus problems

 

RYDER:

What happened to Jien Garson?

 

KESH:

Killed in the Scourge disaster. Her and a bunch of the other leaders. Tann might know more.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Jien Garson

-More about Nexus problems

 

RYDER:

And I thought the Hyperion had it bad when we arrived. Anything else?

 

KESH:

The outposts aren't happening because we don't have resources or people, so Addison's more uptight than ever. And let's not forget how badly the station was damaged on arrival. But that's a detail, according to some. My team and I are repairing what we can. If we don't get materials soon, things will go downhill. Fast.

-Your job

 

RYDER:

When we left the Milky Way, the krogan were still dealing with the genophage.

 

KESH:

Right. The genophage. A little "gift" to our people from the salarians thousands of years ago. That sterility virus they infected us with left most of our children stillborn. Only one in a thousand survive.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Salarian involvement

-State of a cure

 

RYDER:

No wonder your people have such a problem with salarians.

 

KESH:

Some wounds never heal. Not that my ancestors didn't provoke it. They did try to conquer the galaxy. The salarians were forced to respond. And it's not fair to blame it all on them, either. The salarians developed the virus, but it was the turians who deployed it. I'm hoping that's all in the past. Plenty of blame to go around, but Andromeda is about new beginnings. My people need that more than most.

 

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Salarian involvement

RYDER:

What about the krogan here in Andromeda?

 

KESH:

There's no cure for it. But my clan was starting to show a mutation against the virus. A natural defense. During the trip to get here, krogan underwent gene therapies to enhance the mutation while we were in stasis.

 

RYDER:

So you used those 600 years to your advantage. Gave the adaptation more time to develop.

 

KESH:

Yeah. It's still early, but I think we made a dent. Our scientists say we've improved viability to almost 4%, which is a lot better than what we had. Beyond all the statistics, it means more krogan children will live. It's the only way my people have a future out here.

RYDER:

Nothing more for now.

 

KESH:

Try not to die out there.

 

[Ryder leaves Kesh’s office. Behind the platform where Addison’s office can be found is the Nexus information wall. Ryder stands in front of the wall to consult it. As he uses it, different images are displayed. Jien Garson’s picture is shown as she introduces the Welcome Vid.]

 

JIEN GARSON:

Hello. I'm Jien Garson, founder of the Initiative. It's through your hard work that the vision of the Nexus has come to life. You—and all your colleagues—bind our proud new colonies together. Look around at your achievements. And if you have any questions, my door is always open.

WELCOME VID:

Viable planets, capable of supporting life, are key to our survival in Andromeda. The viability of a world is affected by several factors, including temperature, resources, threat levels, political stability, and so on. We have few viable planets currently within range. Resources levels are considered at-risk. 

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

WELCOME VID:

The selection process saw the Andromeda Initiative evaluate thousands of potential habitable planets within the galaxy. After discovering an unusually high ratio of potential candidates, or "golden worlds," the Heleus Cluster was selected as our destination. Even at a distance, studying the light from stars can reveal much about their planets' composition and atmosphere. Seven worlds, nicknamed "habitats," have the life-supporting environments and resources we need to start our new lives in Andromeda.

 

[A technician is standing near the information wall.]

 

TECHNICIAN (COMM):

Melo, you already checked the consoles down here, right? (...) Huh. I think you forgot to hit confirm when you filled out the forms. They're not listed. (...) Nah, it's fine. If you say you fixed them, you did. I'll just check those boxes for you.

(...)

Right then, Lia. Try firing off sets 23-B to 54-C in the third quadrant. (...) Did that work? Excellent. I'll move on to the next set. We'll get this place fixed eventually.

 

[Ryder walks down the ramp. To his right is the militia office, where Kandros is seen standing in front of an oval console where Strike Team missions can be managed. Ryder goes to talk to him.]

 

KANDROS:

I know that look. The others bent your ear, did they?

 

RYDER:

Something like that.

 

KANDROS:

You get used to it. Just focus on being a Pathfinder. Can't argue with results, though they'll try. Anyway, welcome to militia HQ. Excuse the mess. This office fields militia work, Nexus security, and looking for the turian ark.

 

RYDER:

What's the word on the turian ark?

 

KANDROS:

Scattered readings. Some indicate the Natanus was destroyed, others that people are alive—who knows? If you need anything, come see me. Even if it's just to vent.

KANDROS:

I was tired of being the good one.

 

[Kandros uses air quotes when saying “good one.”]

 

RYDER:

"The good one"?

 

KANDROS:

The Kandros family is old military. There were expectations. You know. Then my sister became a sculptor and Cousin Nyreen went pirate on Omega. Everyone was proud that I stayed in service. But I kept wondering "When do I get my adventure?" Jien Garson's dream was so... grand, so gutsy. I had to be part of it.

RYDER:

You talk like you weren't part of the leadership. How did you end up commanding the militia?

 

 

 

KANDROS:

I was escorting a prospecting team on some moon, when those kett found us. They penned us like cattle for experiments. I managed to get loose, snatched a gun, and freed the others. By the time we killed the bastards and headed back to warn the Nexus, everyone looked at me like I was in charge.

 

RYDER:

That sounds familiar.

 

KANDROS:

The militia grew from there. Funny: once the heat is on, all kinds of people rise to the top.

RYDER:

Are the other turians managing okay?

 

KANDROS:

So so. We're not good at sitting around in a crisis. "Service before self" gets drummed into us at boot camp. That's probably why so many of us are in the militia. We like to earn our citizenship, whatever galaxy we're in. But it's hard to focus with our ark missing.

What do you know about the enemies we've encountered—the kett?

 

KANDROS:

We usually see them on worlds with those alien structures. The kett don't take kindly to anyone studying them. Not sure why. They don't talk to us. Every time we cross paths, there's a fight or they take prisoners.

 

RYDER:

Why? What do they want?

 

KANDROS:

No one knows. But I've seen their weaponry, and what they do to those prisoners. I want them a long, long way from the Nexus.

RYDER:

It's rough out there. I might need backup, if you can spare the people.

 

KANDROS:

I have strike teams specializing in assault and extraction. If you need serious firepower, my APEX teams have you covered. In fact... I could give you authority to dispatch them. It'll cut down their response time. Our current ops are on the terminal. See if there's anything that could use a shot where it counts.

 

RYDER:

Bye, Kandros. Duty calls.

 

KANDROS:

You and me both, Pathfinder.

 

[There is a female turian near Kandros. She’s speaking out loud.]

 

MARIETTE:

What am I going to do?

 

[Ryder approaches her.]

 

MARIETTE:

It's not right. It's not fair.

 

RYDER:

What's wrong?

 

MARIETTE:

Oh my, you're... so it's true, a Pathfinder has found us. There's hope at last. Maybe you could help—you're impartial. This whole thing has  gotten so political. My husband… he's locked up and slated for exile—for a crime he didn't commit.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

CASUAL -Must have been bad.

PROFESSIONAL -What was the crime?

 

RYDER:

What exactly was he convicted of?

 

 

MARIETTE:

They don't exile you for petty theft. Well, maybe this bunch would. They say it's murder. They're calling him the first murderer in Andromeda. But the dead man was his friend—he wouldn't have... There are witnesses and evidence, but it's all circumstantial. At worst, it was an accident. His name is Nilken Rensus. He could give you the details, if you were willing to speak with him—please?

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

-Of course.

-There might not be time.

 

RYDER:

I'd be happy to.

 

MARIETTE:

Oh, thank you. I'm sure the jailer will allow you a visit. Please—tell Nilken I love him.

 

[Ryder moves to the far left of the militia office. Liam is there, standing next to tables with multiple terminals and screens above them. A woman is standing next to Liam.]

 

LIAM:

Pathfinder. No time for our beer yet. This place is a mess. Security is... let's call it strained.

 

RYDER:

I can believe it. The Nexus is running on empty.

 

LIAM:

Not just that. A lot of the exiles were security. Everyone was trained and armed for a frontier.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -Let’s not write them off.

LOGICAL -They may all be dead.

 

RYDER:

They were frustrated. If they just wanted to kill, they could have fought to the last here.

 

LIAM:

Apparently we're the big hope for everyone. Not the Hyperion showing. Just... us. I'm with you. It's just... a lot.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

CASUAL -I’m kind of freaked out.

PROFESSIONAL -We’ll get it back to spec.

 

RYDER:

This wasn't in the job description. We have to find a world, then save it.

 

 

LIAM:

Glad it's not just me feeling it. But it's not just you, either. We're a team, right? It's what they need us to be.

 

[Ryder keeps walking and finds himself on the Operations deck. Multiple terminals cover the walls, and crew members are working in front of them. A group of three people are talking amongst themselves near one of the terminals. Ryder gets closer.]

 

PROFESSOR HERIK:

But the planet was toxic. What if they store oxygen in porous tissue, like Quero's rockfish?

 

CHIEF LUCAN:

I still reckon they had breather gear stowed in that armor.

 

DOCTOR ARIDANA:

Perhaps both. Life is infinitely adaptable, as our expedition proves

 

[Professor Herik notices Ryder.]

 

PROFESSOR HERIK:

You must be the Pathfinder. Wonderful! You and your SAM are exactly what we need.

 

RYDER:

Thanks, mister...?

 

PROFESSOR HERIK:

Professor Herik. My colleague and I will work with your SAM and the data you gather to solve Andromeda's scientific mysteries.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -Can I join in?

LOGICAL -What are your specialties?

 

RYDER:

What fields do you study?

 

CHIEF LUCAN:

Herik's into life science. I do planetary geology, oceanography—rocks and runoff. Aridana's the space and math whiz.

 

PROFESSOR HERIK:

Not that we've had much to study, with everyone cooped up for fourteen months...

 

DOCTOR ARIDANA:

But your data on the Scourge flows like poetry. Now we can better advise on repairing the damage it caused.

 

 

PROFESSOR HERIK:

And maybe Addison will give us a real workspace. Who can think with all this racket?

 

[Ryder can talk with each specialist individually. He starts with Doctor Aridana.]

 

DOCTOR ARIDANA:

Pathfinder, we've had some trouble.

 

RYDER:

Anything I can help with?

 

DOCTOR ARIDANA:

Perhaps. I discharged an away team to get readings from a section of the Scourge that was behaving anomalously. They haven't reported in for some time, and sensors can't locate their shuttle. I sent them out there. Good, dedicated people. I fear what might have happened to them.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -Have hope.

LOGICAL -Stay focused.

 

RYDER:

Don’t give up hope. When I’m out there, I’ll see if I can find them.

 

DOCTOR ARIDANA:

Their friends and family will want to know what's happened. And I... I need to know.

 

[Ryder speaks to Chief Lucan next.]

 

CHIEF LUCAN:

Hi, Pathfinder. Want to hit some rocks for science?

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

-Try and stop me.

-Maybe later.

 

CHIEF LUCAN:

Hi, Pathfinder. Want to hit some rocks for science?

 

RYDER:

Absolutely. What do you need?

 

CHIEF LUCAN:

SAM and I used your scans and made a VI for geophysics surveys. Beta build's on the console there. Test it out in the field, and I'll wrangle you a "consultant's bonus" from Director Addison. How's that sound?

 

[Ryder talks to Professor Herik.]

 

PROFESSOR HERIK:

Pathfinder! Those bio scans are superb. Could you gather more for our Comparative Conservation Effort? 

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

-That sounds interesting.

-Sorry, I’m busy.

 

RYDER:

What conservation effort?

 

PROFESSOR HERIK:

Ah, my thesis is on the console there. Broad strokes: we're comparing and preserving organisms from both galaxies. If you donate more bio scans and samples to the catalogue, I can get you a finder's fee. Tempted?

 

[Ryder goes to the console.]

 

PROFESSOR HERIK:

We can start building a bank of vaccines, once we get more biomaterial.

 

CHIEF LUCAN:

It's that Scourge I'm wondering about. Standard colony radiation shields should handle it. But I hate "should."

 

[He activates the mission given to him by the team of scientists.]

 

PROFESSOR HERIK:

And its gas bladder can expand three hundred per cent! Amazing!

 

CHIEF LUCAN:

Hey, Herik. How about you not dissect things over lunch? It's weird.

 

[Ryder speaks with Doctor Aridana again.]

 

DOCTOR ARIDANA:

The beauty of the cosmos unfolds in your planet scans, Pathfinder. But there is more they can do.

 

RYDER:

Do you have something in mind, Doctor?

 

DOCTOR ARIDANA:

Plans for a school are under way, to inspire a new generation of young minds. I want to craft a model of the cluster for them, accurate and splendid, from your data. My prototype is on that console. Add more scans to improve it, and I will share my educational budget with you. And my thanks.

 

[Ryder activates the mission on the console. He then leaves the Operations desk. In the next room, crates are still being unpacked, but three terminals with screens are operational. Ryder can consult the terminal at the center, which shows emails from Director Tann to Tiran Kandros called “Damage Controls” and “Report: Exiles”. Ryder finds his way to the next room near the ramp. In front of him is an arms merchant. To Ryder’s left is a turian standing guard in front of huge glass cell doors. Another turian is locked in one of those cells. Ryder first talks to the arms merchant.]

 

MERCHANT:

Weapons and stuff I got you covered. Use the console to take a look through what I've got. It'd be a lot easier if I weren't missing half my stock...

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

CASUAL -Sure thing.

PROFESSIONAL -What’s with these prices?

 

RYDER:

Ouch. Why am I paying for these?

 

MERCHANT:

Half the supplies are inaccessible, what with how we crash-landed and all. And I have to trade with the crooks out there for the rest, so...

 

[After looking at what the merchant has to offer, Ryder finds the turian by the cells, Sergeant Aker.]

 

SERGEANT AKER:

Help you?

 

RYDER:

Pathfinder Ryder. Here to see Nilken Rensus.

 

SERGEANT AKER:

Ah, our murderer. Wife's here all the time. Guess she told you her sob story.

 

[Sergeant Aker looks at the turian in the cell.]

 

SERGEANT AKER:

Nilken, you're moving up in the world. There's a Pathfinder wanting to chat with you.

 

[In the cell, Nilken Rensus steps forward so he can face Ryder.]

 

RENSUS:

A Pathfinder, huh? They called in the big guns to exile Andromeda's First Murderer.

 

 

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -Wife says you’re innocent.

LOGICAL -Not why I’m here.

 

RYDER:

Your wife's all broken up over this. She says you didn't do it. And that she loves you.

 

RENSUS:

(Sighs.) She's a wonderful person. At this point, it's too late. They found me guilty.

 

RYDER:

Why don't you tell me what happened?

 

RENSUS:

I was part of the futile effort to set up a colony on Eos. We were on our last legs, overrun by hostiles, our leader dead. The security chief, Reynolds—my friend—he refused to call for evacuation. I argued with him. Everyone saw.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -Arguments happen.

LOGICAL -And then he ended up dead?

 

RYDER:

So when he was killed, people assumed you did it?

 

RENSUS:

For good reason. He ordered us to regroup and counter attack. We were moving through a sandstorm. I saw movement, thought it was the kett, and I—I guess I panicked and fired... A witness saw the Chief's chest explode.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -That’s terrible.

LOGICAL -So it was unintentional.

 

RYDER:

Sounds like an accident.

 

 

RENSUS:

That's what I told them. But I was enraged when we argued. There's a recording. It's ugly. Everyone's certain I did it on purpose so we could evacuate. Only my word otherwise.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -Don’t give up.

LOGICAL -The evidence will decide.

 

RYDER:

I'll check out the evidence. Maybe something doesn't add up.

 

RENSUS:

It would be nice to have someone with an open mind looking at it. You're a Pathfinder—I'm sure Kandros would give you access. Maybe there's still hope.

 

[Ryder leaves. The technician is still upstairs on the comm—Ryder can hear him.]

 

TECHNICIAN:

Lia, remember when I said I was going to take a look inside the panel here? I should perhaps have listened when you suggested not pursuing this course of action. No, I'm fine. Just a bump on my head. And don't you dare laugh.

(...)

No, I'm fine. No, nothing happened. Honestly, Yolanda. I'm fine. I'm going back to work now.

 

[Tann’s office is located on the far left of Colonials Affairs. Ryder walks up the ramp and hears the Operations Manager.]

 

OPERATIONS MANAGER:

Yeah, looks like the Blast-Ohs got displaced at the last minute. Hopefully one of the other arks will have some in stock. I'll keep an eye out.

 

[Ryder finds Kandros again.]

 

KANDROS:

No news on the turian ark yet. Or is this militia business?

 

RYDER:

I spoke with Nilken Rensus. The man found guilty of the murder on Eos.

 

KANDROS:

Yes, our first murder here in Andromeda. I wish it had been our last. When the colony attempts failed, it didn't help spirits that a high-ranking officer was killed by one of our own. The mutiny here on Nexus was probably inevitable but this acted as a spark.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -Isn’t that a reach?

LOGICAL -And he was found guilty.

 

RYDER:

It doesn't seem right to put all that on him.

 

KANDROS:

of course it isn't. But that's the perception. Despite the lack of physical evidence, everything added up. His only defense was: "Trust me. I didn't mean to do it."

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -And you didn’t trust him?

LOGICAL -That matters.

RYDER:

And you assume he's lying.

 

KANDROS:

What's a lie to a murderer? Look, knock yourself out. A key witness, Cassidy Shaw, works in Operations. Go ahead and talk to her. And there's a recording of the perpetrator threatening the victim. I'll let you cue it up on the console there. As far as I'm concerned, this case is closed.

 

[Ryder goes to the console and listens to the recording.]

 

KANDROS (AUDIO LOG):

The Nexus vs Colonist Nilken. Evidence 7-A.

 

RENSUS (AUDIO LOG):

Hiram? Hiram! They've seized the compound! Call for evacuation!

 

CHIEF REYNOLDS (AUDIO LOG):

We're not giving up, Nilken! We're taking it back!

 

RENSUS (AUDIO LOG):

No! I'm not letting your ego get us killed, even if I have to...! (Angry grunting.)

 

CHIEF REYNOLDS (AUDIO LOG):

(Grunting.) No! Get him off me—get him off me!

 

[The recording ends. A few feet from the console, Liam is still talking to the woman from the Security team.]

 

LIAM:

Noticed a hand-off there. Too small for illicits.

 

SECURITY:

You'd be surprised. There's ossilbir vine in the seed bank.

 

LIAM:

Nobody's making creeper in Andromeda.

 

SECURITY:

You'd be surprised.

 

[Ryder goes to speak with him.]

 

LIAM:

Pathfinder, I'm feeling less bad about missing a year of this. Everyone's beaten down. Nothing to do but watch the reserves shrink.

 

 

RYDER:

And now all eyes are on us.

 

LIAM:

All I know is: we have to fix it.

 

(...)

 

LIAM:

Quieter here. Still get opinions, of course. And talk to security. 

 

RYDER:

What about?

 

LIAM:

Leaders. Direction. Lack of it. Tann is the standout but none of them have made friends.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -It pisses me off.

LOGICAL -Who would you support?

 

RYDER:

Who would you say is actually measuring up?

 

LIAM:

My dad would say elections were rubbish, because you don't get people who could do the job, you got politicians. By that measure, I'd go Addison. She does not want that job.

 

[Ryder goes to the Colonial Affairs’s deck. The final docking procedures are in progress.]

 

NEXUS CONTROL:

All right, moving on. Docking clamps?

 

LANI:

Fully active and engaged.

 

NEXUS CONTROL:

Docking hatch integrity?

LANI:

100%, Nexus Control.

 

NEXUS CONTROL:

And we're done. Hyperion status: all clear.

 

[Ryder approaches Cassidy Shaw.]

 

RYDER:

Cassidy Shaw? I'm Scott Ryder. I'm looking into the Nilken murder case.

CASSIDY SHAW:

Oh man, I thought that was over with. Have you heard of the audio recording of their flight?

 

RYDER:

Yes.

 

CASSIDY SHAW:

I helped pull him off Chief Reynolds. You could see it in his eyes: he was going to kill him. Then in the sandstorm... I had a pretty clear view of the Chief. He looked right at Nilken and shouted "No!" Then his chest burst open. I'll never forget it: the look on his face was pure... shock.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Were there kett there?

-Did Nilken regret it?

-Why was the Chief shocked?

-Did you agree with the Chief?

 

RYDER:

Did you see any kett in the vicinity?

Nilken said so, but not that I could see. Still, the sandstorm was severe. Visibility wasn't great.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Were there kett there?

-Did Nilken regret it?

-Why was the Chief shocked?

-Did you agree with the Chief?

 

RYDER:

Did Nilken seem remorseful?

I lost sight of Nilken in the turmoil. When we found him, he seemed in shock. He couldn't speak—he looked nauseated. Could have been guilt—the reality of the act sinking in.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Were there kett there?

-Did Nilken regret it?

-Why was the Chief shocked?

-Did you agree with the Chief? 

 

RYDER:

If they'd fought and Nilken threatened to kill him, why was Reynolds surprised?

 

 

CASSIDY SHAW:

Friends fight, say things they don't mean, maybe even hurt each other... But you don't expect your best friend to shoot you. To me, that's the saddest part. The Chief's heart was broken right before it exploded.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Were there kett there?

-Did Nilken regret it?

-Why was the Chief shocked?

-Did you agree with the Chief? 

 

RYDER:

Reynolds was leading you back to retake the compound. Did you agree with that?

 

CASSIDY SHAW:

It wasn't my place to agree or disagree. He was ranking officer. In retrospect, it is ironic. If he hadn't been killed, we all probably would have died.

 

RYDER:

I appreciate the information.

 

CASSIDY SHAW:

Of course. It kills me we had to leave him behind. He deserved a proper funeral.

 

RYDER:

So the body was never examined? Important piece of a murder investigation.

 

CASSIDY SHAW:

Tann wouldn't allow a mission to go back for him. Said it was too dangerous.

 

[Ryder is about to leave the deck when he hears Lani.]

 

LANI:

Nexus Control, I'm getting some odd automated requests from the station's systems. Some sort of redundant power relay checks. What's up with that?

 

NEXUS CONTROL:

Before we removed them from the station, the mutineers left some surprises in the system. The superintendent has had everyone on deck manually double-checking the relays. It'll be in the security update, somewhere in your message queue.

 

[He leaves the deck. The salarian technician and the Operations Manager are still near the same console on the main bridge, talking to one another.]

 

OPERATIONS MANAGER:

Melo?

 

 

MELO:

Yes?

 

OPERATIONS MANAGER:

You realize everyone can hear you, right?

 

MELO:

Yes.

 

OPERATIONS MANAGER:

(Chuckles.) And you just don't care.

 

MELO:

Yes!

 

[Ryder walks past them and finds his way to Tann’s Office.]

 

SCENE II
Talking to Tann
[Ryder heads to Tann’s office. Cora is there talking to Tann. Both are watching data from a console in front of them.]

 

CORA:

...This is the planet where we landed, Habitat 7. It wasn't even close to livable.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

That's been true of every world we've found.

 

[Tann notices Ryder, who stands in front of the console on the opposite side from Tann and Cora.]

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

Ryder—we were discussing your next expedition.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

CASUAL -About time.

PROFESSIONAL -You trust me now?

 

RYDER:

I thought I didn't measure up as Pathfinder.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

Director Addison keeps her own counsel, I keep mine.

 

RYDER:

And when you disagree?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

I oversee the entire Initiative, and I've decided to give you a chance to prove yourself. To that end, the Scourge dealt us a serious blow. Whatever it is, our scientists theorize it's not natural.

 

CORA:

An artificial energy cloud?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

It wasn't here when we left the Milky Way. Yet it rendered all the golden worlds unlivable. Then there's the aliens you ran into—"the kett." They're obsessed with alien structures we've found scattered around the cluster. They'll do anything to prevent others from accessing them. It seems murder isn't exclusive to the Milky Way.

 

[Tann touches the console.]

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

And now the challenge is to settle a world in spite of all that. This one here—"Eos."

 

[A projection of Eos appears above the console.]

 

RYDER:

How?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

You need to increase the viability of the planet so we can establish an outpost. Then we can bring more colonists out of stasis. The more colonists we have, the more resources we can gather to support the Nexus. Everything depends on it. There are six worlds we hope to settle.

 

RYDER:

Okay... but you said every planet you found is unlivable. So, how do I...

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

A good Pathfinder would relish the challenge of solving it.

 

CORA:

Right. I think I should... go check on things.

 

[Cora leaves Tann’s office.]

 

RYDER:

And if I fail, I guess it's no sweat off your back, right? You'll just look for another Pathfinder?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

Placing bets on people is part of my job. Some of them pay off. Others...

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

CASUAL -Don’t play games with me.

PROFESSIONAL -Just point the way.

 

RYDER:

Just point me to my ship, and I'll be out of here.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

They're prepping it now, in the docking bay. The coordinates for Eos will be in the computer. And when you have a moment, we should discuss the missing arks.

 

RYDER:

I was wondering about tha—

 

[Ryder hears a piercing noise, which makes him grunt in discomfort.]

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

Something wrong?

 

SAM (PRIVATE):

Ryder, please see me in SAM Node on the Hyperion. Your implant needs attention, and we need to discuss a confidential matter.

 

[Ryder listens to SAM without saying anything, then raises his hand in reply to Tann.]

 

RYDER:

No... I'm fine.

 

-> Additional scenes II

 

[Ryder can have a longer conversation with Director Tann in his office.]

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

Ryder. You have my condolences for your father.

 

RYDER:

I appreciate it.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

I didn't know him very well, although I understand he played a key role in planning the Initiative. I'm sure he'd be concerned that we still have several arks missing.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -I’ll find them.

LOGICAL -What happened to them?

 

RYDER:

Any idea where they went?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

Nothing certain. But tens of thousands of colonists are unaccounted for. It paints the Initiative in an unflattering light. Did you have some other business?

RYDER:

It sounds like the Nexus has had a rough time of it.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

Publicly, I would say we're more than up for the challenge. Privately, I can tell you it's been a disaster. The Scourge killed hundreds—many of them our senior leadership. Even the founder of the Initiative, Jien Garson, is dead.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Jien Garson's death

-Scourge disaster

-Mysteries on Habitat 7

 

RYDER:

How did Jien Garson die?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

With the rest of the leadership. When the Nexus hit the Scourge, a large wing of stasis pods was destroyed. They were killed instantly. These people traveled for 600 years and died before they even woke up. Jien Garson never glimpsed Heleus. She never saw her vision realized.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Jien Garson's death

-Scourge disaster

-Mysteries on Habitat 7

 

RYDER:

Kandros mentioned something about hitting the Scourge. How did it play out?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

Criminal elements took advantage of the emergency and preyed on people's fears. An uprising followed. We had no choice but to turn to the krogan to deal with them. They crushed the mutiny and the criminals were banished. "Exiles," we call them. I doubt we've heard the last of them. They're led by an outlaw. Sloane Kelly. She used to be one of ours.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Sloane Kelly

-Where are the krogan?

 

RYDER:

Who is this Sloane Kelly?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

She was head of security on the Nexus. She opposed the uprising at first, but eventually turned traitor and joined them. Misguided sympathy for the plight of the common citizen. Nonsense. They posed a direct threat to our existence.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Sloane Kelly

-Where are the krogan?

 

RYDER:

There don't seem to be many krogan around.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

Good riddance. The krogan demanded a greater say in political matters—the last place you want them involved. They're muscle, nothing more. Good for fighting and lifting heavy objects. When they didn't get what they wanted, they left.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Sloane Kelly

-Where are the krogan?

-Dislike for krogan

 

RYDER:

Why don't you like the krogan?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

It's common knowledge they're a violent, ignorant species. Long ago, they waged nuclear war on one another. Their planet was decimated. My people tried to uplift them, but the krogan could never tame their worst instincts. What if they bring their tempers to Andromeda? We'll all be dead.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Jien Garson's death

-Scourge disaster

-Mysteries on Habitat 7

 

 

 

RYDER:

We came across alien technology on Habitat 7. It seemed to affect the weather. Your people know anything about that?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

There have been reports. Failed scouting missions have mentioned advanced structures of unknown design. Whatever they are, they defy explanation. But with our resources stretched so tight, no one has had a chance to study them. And what if the answer was bad for morale? Suppose these things turn people into food? All we know is the kett are interested in them. I'd rather not stir things up.

RYDER:

What more can you tell me about the Initiative?

DIRECTOR TANN:

It represents the greatest migration ever attempted. No one had ventured beyond the Milky Way before. We've all left home in search of freedom, fortune, perhaps a new beginning. We're the bravest souls each species has to offer. I hope the Nexus will serve as the seat of government for us all.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Initiative origins

-Motivations for coming

-Alien species on Nexus

 

RYDER:

What do you know about the early days of the Initiative?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

As most everyone knows, Jien Garson's vision made it happen. She was an entrepreneur on Earth. Wealthy. Young for a human. Garson had the idea for the Initiative in the early 2170s, I believe. Many thought leaving the Milky Way was impossible. But she persevered. And as with most great ideas, the doubters were wrong.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Initiative origins

-Motivations for coming

-Alien species on Nexus

 

RYDER:

Why do you think most people came?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

There are thousands of reasons, one for every colonist here. What does any pilgrim seek? Usually, happiness. Finding the thing that eludes them... the thing to fulfill them. While we can't promise they will find it, we can facilitate the search.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Initiative origins

-Motivations for coming

-Alien species on Nexus

 

RYDER:

It looks like a melting pot around here.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

The Nexus is home to several Initiative species. Many came ahead of the arks. The hope is that this station will one day serve as the governing body in Andromeda. Though I'm not sure what they were thinking, lumping krogan into the mix. As a salarian, my kind tend to have a low opinion of them. Nothing I’ve seen here has changed that.

RYDER:

As Director of the Initiative, are you in charge around here or what?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

If the others would allow me. They don't see me as the right successor.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Gridlock?

-Why the doubt?

 

RYDER:

So how does anything get done?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

In theory, Kesh handles the Nexus' physical operations, Kandros runs the militia, and Addison manages Colonial Affairs. I oversee all of it. In practice, we argue, debate, and yell at each other until a decision is made... if we're lucky. it is maddening.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Gridlock?

-Why the doubt?

 

RYDER:

What's their problem with you?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

I'm not Jien Garson. Our founder was charismatic. Eccentric. Larger than life. Traits I can't hope to mimic. She and her inner circle perished in the Scourge. Some at the hands of the exiles. Some never made it out of stasis. I was Deputy Assistant for Revenue Management. Then all seven leaders above me died. I was next in line for the role.

 

RYDER:

So... you're an accountant?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

Don't let that fool you. We're all capable of more than we know. When I was young, I was fascinated by the idea of exploring space. Life had its detours and I went a different direction. Then I heard about the Initiative—and saw my chance to try the path not taken. While I may not be setting foot on new worlds, my authority can ensure that you do.

 

RYDER:

Right. Sorry.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Nexus troubles

-The Andromeda Initiative

-Tann's role

-Missing arks

-Planet viability

 

RYDER:

Any more information you can give me on the missing arks?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

No, and that's the distressing part. The asari, turian, and salarian arks are completely unaccounted for. If they had the same problems with the Scourge that we did, I fear the worst. Should you find any clues, please investigate. Without the other arks, the promise of the Initiative can never be fulfilled.

 

RYDER:

Are there any other arks we should expect?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

We'd hoped quarians would be part of the first wave. But before departure in 2185, we got word they had technical problems with their ship. It seems they're also bringing along drell, hanar, and other species as well. Managing all their biological needs caused complications. We won't see them for some time to come.

 

 

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Nexus troubles

-The Andromeda Initiative

-Tann's role

-Missing arks

-Planet viability

 

RYDER:

What do I need to consider in making a planet viable?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

Assuming the planet supports life, an outpost is critical. People like a roof over their heads. And you'll want to eliminate any hostile threats. Whether that's the kett, or other terrors lurking in Heleus, colonists being murdered on sight can be discouraging. Also, scouting and mapping terrain is a priority for any Pathfinder. And don't forget forward stations. You'll want those.

 

RYDER:

What can you tell me about forward stations?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

I was afraid you'd ask. It's mostly what the engineers tell me. "A forward station allows mining, equipment repairs, and re-supply for field teams." I mean, who wouldn't want that? But seeing as how every colonization effort has failed, it's just theory at the moment. You get to test it out, Ryder.

 

[Ryder can now ask him about the Nilken Rensus case.]

 

RYDER:

I'm looking into the Nilken Rensus murder charge.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

And?

 

RYDER:

I want to go to Eos and retrieve Chief Reynold's body.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

That isn't usually Pathfinder business.

 

RYDER:

First murder in Andromeda. And I'm impartial—figured you'd want to get it right.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

Settling an outpost comes first, but I suppose I have no objections. Physical evidence will only bolster the case.

 

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -I’m not sure he did it.

LOGICAL -The body can reveal much.

 

RYDER:

The more certain we can be, the better.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

All right, but let's keep it quiet. I don't want people thinking we're opening the case. I hope anything you find reaffirms what's been done. But if it sheds a different light, we'll deal with it. We'll send the coordinates of the murder scene. Good luck.

 

RYDER:

That's all. Thanks for your time.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

I'm happy to help. You'll find our futures depend on each other's success. Good luck.

 

[Ryder leaves Tann’s office. In the Operations Center, directly in front of him and below the Colonial Affairs deck, a technician named Raj Patil is working on a panel.]

 

RAJ PATIL:

Yeah, looks fine so far...

 

[The panel short-circuits and smoke comes out of it. Raj Patil cries out in surprise and pain. Ryder walks toward him.]

 

RYDER:

Hey—you okay?

 

RAJ PATIL:

I'm fine. My arms got the brunt of it.

 

RYDER:

Stuff exploding like this happen often?

 

RAJ PATIL:

Back right after the mutiny, we had a lot of this happening, but not lately.

 

RYDER:

I wasn't there during the mutiny.

 

RAJ PATIL:

Lucky. I thought we were done with this, honestly. That maybe I was just being paranoid...

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

CASUAL -Is it paranoia?

PROFESSIONAL -Why paranoid?

 

RYDER:

What is there to be paranoid about?

 

RAJ PATIL:

We've had three malfunctions in the past week.

 

RYDER:

That's not good. Sorry, understatement.

 

RAJ PATIL:

Yeah. (Sighs.) And now I have more repairs.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -This has to stop.

LOGICAL -Did you report this?

 

RYDER:

Did you talk to security about this?

 

 

RAJ PATIL:

How can I? For all I know, someone in security is the one doing this! I've scanned all the potential sabotage areas I can think of, but I don't know who to trust anymore.

 

RYDER:

Sounds like a lot went down before the Hyperion docked.

 

RAJ PATIL:

Yeah, I guess. Wait—that's it. You can't possibly be involved in this. You weren't even here during the mutiny. Would you—if you have time, maybe you could help me? If they start hitting critical  systems...

 

RYDER:

Sure thing. What can I do?

 

RAJ PATIL:

If you could scan these other panels while I fix this one, that'd really help. I've sent the locations to your omni-tool. Just send me the data when you're done.

 

[Ryder has to investigate the panels in the Operations Center, Militia, and Pathfinder HQ sites.]

 

RAJ PATIL (COMM):

No, I'm fine. And I don't know—it just blew up.

 

KESH (COMM):

Find out why. Be careful.

 

[Ryder first scans the panel on Colonial Affairs’s deck.]

 

SAM:

Scanning power junction relays. The panel is malfunctioning. Without more data, I cannot determine if this is a normal malfunction or sabotage.

 

RYDER:

I'll just disable power to the panel until Raj can check it out.

 

[Ryder goes back to Operations Center, walks down the ramp, and scans the panel to its left.]

 

SAM:

Pathfinder, to cover their tracks, the saboteur is overloading power to this panel from another junction relay. You can scan and trace the connective wiring to locate the surrogate panel.

 

[Ryder can scan the panel in the Milita site, then proceed to scan the one in the Pathfinder HQ site (also known as Tann's office).]

 

SAM:

Scan and trace the wiring the locate the panel that the saboteur used.

 

[Ryder follows the wiring and scans a panel near Kesh’s office.]

 

RAJ PATIL (COMM):

Pathfinder, I received the data from SAM. It really is sabotage.

 

RYDER:

Any idea as to who it might be?

 

RAJ PATIL (COMM):

Yeah. All these panels were worked on by Zarah. I just can't believe it.

 

SAM:

Security video logs confirm that Zarah Kellus worked on these panels, as well as the one Raj Patil encountered.

 

RYDER:

Well, shit. Any idea where she is now?

 

SAM:

Kellus is currently working on a panel on the Hyperion main deck.

 

[As Ryder leaves, he hears Melo—the salarian technician on the main bridge—talking.]

 

 

 

MELO:

Kesh, this is Melo. The console for the secondary management system is mixed. Everything checks out. It should sync up with the Hyperion's remote consoles. Moving on to the next thing on my list.

 

[Cora is found near the tram, using her omni-tool. She stops what she’s doing when Ryder comes to talk to her.]

 

RYDER:

Hey, there.

 

CORA:

You okay? Those guys really grilled you. And Addison. First Pathfinder they've seen in over a year, all she can do is question your competence?

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -Addison wasn't my favorite.

LOGICAL -Her reaction's understandable.

CASUAL -Which one was Addison?

PROFESSIONAL -Nothing I couldn't handle.

 

RYDER:

I expected something like that. I can handle the pressure.

 

CORA:

I worked out logistics with Director Tann. They're giving us a ship and crew. He said their best is taking care of it.

 

RYDER:

I still need to head back to the ark and check in with SAM.

 

CORA:

Sounds good. While you're there, maybe see how your sister is doing.

 

[Ryder takes the tram leading to the Hyperion Habitation Deck. He arrives in the Atrium, where several crew members are talking.]

 

CREW 1:

What's the latest about waking people up?

 

CREW 2:

We're in a holding pattern. Word is that the Nexus doesn't have enough room.

 

CREW 1:

But they've been here for like a year, haven't they?

 

CREW 2:

Yeah. I guess it didn't go so well.

 

[Ryder finds Zarah Kellus near a panel.]

 

RYDER:

Zarah Kellus?

 

ZARAH KELLUS:

Yes?

 

RYDER:

I have evidence you've been sabotaging the Nexus.

 

ZARAH KELLUS:

What? No! I'd never—I've been looking into this myself. I have the scans to prove it! Here—I'll transfer the scans I took to your omni-tool.

 

RYDER:

Funny. Raj was investigating the same thing—and it led us to you.

 

ZARAH KELLUS:

My scans point at Raj as the one... so unless someone was setting us both up, I just don't understand.

 

SAM (PRIVATE):

The data Miss Kellus has accumulated is strangely similar to Mr Patil's. A third party seems likely.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

CASUAL -You’ve been set up.

PROFESSIONAL -Decoy tactic?

 

RYDER:

The real saboteur could be setting you both up.

 

ZARAH KELLUS:

Because we both figured out something was going on? That would make sense. It's better than thinking Raj could have done this. But it means all the data I have is useless. Wish I had access to the security cams. I bet we could find something there.

 

RYDER:

You stay put, so whoever did this doesn't realize we're on to them. I'll check out the security cams.

 

[Ryder contacts Raj.]

 

RYDER:

Raj, you there?

 

RAJ PATIL (COMM):

Yes. How did it go? Is it-is it really her?

 

RYDER:

Wasn't her. She had "proof" pointing at you. I figure someone's been messing with you both. Just keep a low profile and don't talk to anyone. I'm on it.

 

[Ryder goes back to the Nexus’s Operations Center to check the security footage. The first footage shows a grey static-filled screen.]

 

RYDER:

The file is useless. Let's check another.

 

[Ryder checks another file. The result is the same.]

 

RYDER:

And another scrambled file.

 

 

SAM:

Coincidence seems unlikely.

 

RYDER:

Let's check another.

 

[This time the screen shows images, but they’re blurry.]

 

RYDER:

This file is also corrupted. Definitely not a coincidence. You'd need pretty high clearance to mess with the security camera files. Someone working for Kandros, maybe.

 

SAM:

That is the most probable scenario.

 

RYDER:

Think you can get enough out of the files to find a match using biometric scans, SAM?

 

SAM:

The files were badly scrambled, but if I combine all the available identifiers, it might work. Based on the limited information available, we are looking for a human male assigned either to the Nexus or Hyperion. You will need to conduct scans from close proximity.

 

RYDER:

Got it.

 

[Ryder goes to the Militia site, scans a man working for Nexus security.]

 

 

SAM:

Inaccurate match.

 

[Ryder goes below the Colonial Affairs deck and scans another man working for Nexus security.]

 

SAM:

Negative match.

 

[Ryder goes to the Hyperion Habitation Deck to scan members of Nexus security transferred to the Hyperion. He begins by scanning a man standing guard outside of the tram.]

 

SAM:

Inaccurate match.

 

[As he makes his way to the Hyperion's Atrium, he sees a man kneeling near a panel. Ryder scans him. It's a match.]

 

SAM:

Scan results show a partial positive. Target is most likely suspect.

 

RYDER:

Who is he?

 

SAM:

Dale Atkins. Reports to Kandros' department. Assigned to station security.

 

[Ryder approaches Atkins, who remains kneeling with his back turned.]

 

RYDER:

Dale Atkins, right? We need to talk.

 

DALE ATKINS:

Look, not to be rude, but I have work to do...

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

CASUAL -Is that what you call it?

PROFESSIONAL -I don’t think so.

 

RYDER:

We know what you've been up to. You're done here.

 

DALE ATKINS:

I-I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just doing my job, that's all!

 

RYDER:

Proof says you've been up to no good.

 

DALE ATKINS:

Figures. Screw this. Screw all you hypocrites on this station. You weren't here when they kicked out our loved ones. Mutiny? We just wanted answers. My sister is out there! I don't even know if she's alive or...

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -I sympathize, but...

LOGICAL -Your actions are unforgivable.

 

RYDER:

I'm sorry for what happened, but setting explosives isn't the answer.

 

DALE ATKINS:

Neither was sending people into exile because they didn't agree with policy. (Sighs.) I don't care what you think. The mutiny leaders were right to demand to know what was going on.

 

RYDER:

You could have hurt people. Killed them.

 

DALE ATKINS:

Like those who got killed when the leadership had the krogan stomp on my friends? I'm done talking. I confess: it was me. Do whatever you want.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -You need to go.

LOGICAL -Not up to me.

 

RYDER:

Not my call. The Nexus leaders will make that decision.

 

DALE ATKINS:

That lot, make a decision? That'll be the day.

 

[With that finished, Ryder continues to the Hyperion Atrium. There he spots the Hyperion pilot (Lani) and captain (Dunn). He first approaches Lani, who is standing by a panel close to the one Zarah Kellus was inspecting.]

 

LANI:

Pathfinder. It's good to see you. Word is there's been trouble on the station...

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

CASUAL -It’ll get better.

PROFESSIONAL -Where’d you hear that?

 

RYDER:

We're here now. It'll get better.

 

 

LANI:

That's what I've been telling people. You're here now! As soon as we establish outposts, everything will even out. I'm sure of it.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-And your family?

-Why are you here?

-What's it like here?

 

RYDER:

What about your family?

 

LANI:

I'm an orphan. My parents died on the Mindoir colony when it was attacked years ago. No siblings. I left friends and some distant relatives behind, but I have friends here, too. I love piloting, but I like the idea of going back to my roots and farming like my parents did. Someday.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-And your family?

-Why are you here?

-What's it like here?

 

RYDER:

Why did you join the Initiative?

 

LANI:

Ah, the most popular question on the station. Honestly, I wouldn't have known about this project if Nozomi hadn't reached out to me.

 

RYDER:

Nozomi?

 

LANI:

Captain Dunn. Of all the captains I've piloted for, she's the best. I've always been a wanderer at heart. When she asked me to be her pilot... how could I say no to the adventure of a lifetime?

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-And your family?

-Why are you here?

-What's it like here?

 

RYDER:

How do you feel about all this now that we're here?

 

 

 

LANI:

Hopeful. I know, it's a rose-colored outlook, but... Someone's gotta keep the positivity coming, right?

 

RYDER:

Have to go now. See you later.

 

LANI:

Take care.

 

[Captain Dunn is standing on the far side of the Atrium. Ryder now walks toward her.]

 

CAPTAIN DUNN:

Ryder.

 

RYDER:

You're not on the bridge, Captain?

 

CAPTAIN DUNN:

We powered it down. Can't afford to waste energy. Though cryo bay and SAM Node are exempt. And I told them to keep their hands off Alec's quarters. You have access now.

 

RYDER:

Thanks.

 

CAPTAIN DUNN:

Hey—sorry about your father. He was really good at what he did. Just not so good at working with people. He was right about going planetside, though.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -I'll miss him.

LOGICAL -I didn't really know him.

CASUAL -He was difficult.

PROFESSIONAL -Only work mattered to him.

 

RYDER:

I wish he were still here. There's so much he would have taught me.

 

CAPTAIN DUNN:

You'll do fine. You're off to a good start. If there's anything else I can help with, let me know.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Your role

RYDER:

Now that the Hyperion is docked, what will you do?

 

CAPTAIN DUNN:

Normally I'd supervise thawing out the colonists, but that's been put on hold. I hear you're the one helping resolve the issue. Good luck with that.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

RYDER:

If someone had told you that you'd be in the Andromeda cluster, even five years ago...

 

CAPTAIN DUNN:

Are you kidding me? I'd have laughed them out of the quadrant. Although the way things are now isn't exactly what I was hoping for, either. We all knew there was a possibility on arrival of less than ideal circumstances. When you sign up, you hope for the best and plan for the worst.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Your role

-Expectations

-Joining the Initiative

 

RYDER:

Why did you join the Initiative? We're a long way from home...

 

CAPTAIN DUNN:

How could I not? I love my job. Coming here, all this... it was just a logical extension of what I already do. Sailing through new stars, discovering new worlds... what self-respecting explorer could pass that up?

 

RYDER:

Thanks for the talk.

 

CAPTAIN DUNN:

All right. I have requests to submit, administrators to harass, and people to wake up. I'd better get to it. Good luck out there.

 

[Ryder leaves the Atrium, passes by SAM Node to arrive at Alec’s quarters. It’s guarded by a man who nods at Ryder. In Alec’s quarters, directly to the right of the entrance is a wall of shelves displaying weapons. Ryder examines Alec’s sidearm.]

 

SAM:

Your father's first sidearm. A memento of his early Alliance service.

 

RYDER:

I bet that saw plenty of action.

SAM:

Alec’s first kill occured in combat during the First Contact War.

 

RYDER:

Back when turians were the enemy. Crazy times.

 

[There is a shelf above the bed in the corner across from the entrance. Ryder can pick up a model of the Normandy SR-2. A partition to the left of the entrance doubles as a library. Ryder examines the books.]

 

RYDER:

Printed books?

 

SAM:

Reproductions of Lewis and Clark’s journals, detailing their expedition in the 19th century.

 

RYDER:

Explains Dad’s interest. They were pathfinders, too.

 

[Behind the partition-library is the kitchen, where Ryder notices a coffee machine.]

 

RYDER:

(Laughs.) The coffee machine Mom got for Dad. He was so busy designing you—needed the caffeine.

 

SAM:

I did not realize I owed my existence to a bean.

 

RYDER:

And now you know what humility feels like.

 

[In the center of the far wall past the kitchen area is the Archive System: a desk with multiple screens on top.]

 

RYDER:

What’s on here, SAM?

 

SAM:

Your father’s personal logs. Several of them are encrypted.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-General Logs

-Encrypted Log #1

-Encrypted Log #2

-Encrypted Log #3

-Encrypted Log #4

 

[Ryder selects General Logs.]

 

GENERAL LOGS OPTIONS:

-Milky Way departure

-Asari archaeologist

-Final entry

 

ALEC RYDER:

The day is finally here. We’re pushing off from Earth. We’ll jump through a few relays first, then we hunker down for the long trip across dark space. It’s daunting, thinking about all the hopes and dreams aboard the Hyperion. I certainly have my own. I wasn’t the husband or father I should’ve been. Here’s hoping 600 years can change a man.

 

GENERAL LOGS OPTIONS:

-Milky Way departure

-Asari archaeologist: Dr. Liara T’Soni

-Final entry

 

ALEC RYDER:

Sam, this is a reminder about Dr. Liara T’Soni—she’s an asari archeologist I corresponded with a few years back. She’s got experience studying ancient cultures. Make sure the team gets her research. Could be useful in Andromeda.

 

RYDER:

Pretty sure my sister mentioned Dr. T’Soni. An expert on Protheans, I think?

 

SAM:

I have loaded Dr. T’Soni’s research onto datapads.

 

[Ryder listens to Dr. T’Soni Message #1.]

 

DR. T’SONI:

Hello, Alec—this is Dr. T’Soni. I’m flattered you contacted me. Most scientists dismiss my work. But I’m young and asari, and they’re getting older, so we’ll see who has the final word. (Laughs.) In the meantime, I’m happy to pass along my research. I hope your team finds it useful.

 

[Ryder listens to Dr. T’Soni Message #2.]

 

DR. T’SONI:

Hello, Alec. I received your message. I must say, the thought of exploring another galaxy has my head spinning. I’m honestly not sure how people could survive a trip like that. And anyway, I couldn’t bear to leave the Milky Way behind. There’s so much about the Protheans I still hope to learn here, so much potential wisdom to tap. I wish you much good luck and future success.

 

 

 

 

GENERAL LOGS OPTIONS:

-Milky Way departure

-Asari archaeologist: Dr. Liara T’Soni

-Final entry

 

ALEC RYDER:

Dunn’s agreed to a scouting mission on Habitat 7. I’m gearing up now. I’m worried about Sara. Dr. T’Perro says she’ll be fine, but… she’s my daughter. How can I not worry? I hate to leave her like this. It’s these moments when you wish you’d told your children you loved them more often. Or ever. Which brings me to the tough part. Kids, if anything happens to me, there are… things you’re going to find out. I hope you’ll understand.

 

[Ryder tries to listen to one of the encrypted logs.]

 

SAM:

That log is inaccessible at this time.

 

[There is an audio excerpt on the Archive Systems desk. Ryder can listen to it.]

 

DR. T’SONI:

When studying a dead race, the most obvious problem is the lack of an observable population. This raises the question: When is a species truly extinct? The Prothean civilization spanned the galaxy, and it took centuries to confirm that all members of the species really had died out. While it's possible that living Protheans may be found in a hidden pocket of the galaxy one day, the chances are statistically trivial. Once an extinction is confirmed, the study's nature moves from sociology to exo-archeology.

 

[Ryder steps away. Back on a table between the Archive Systems and the bed is an audio excerpt. Ryder can listen to it.]

 

DR. T’SONI:

I’m Dr. Liara T’Soni, and I’ve spent several decades researching ancient Protheans. It’s common knowledge that the Protheans were an advanced race that flourished in the Milky Way about 50 000 years ago, then went extinct. Even at the time of this writing—the year 2182–their culture remains a mystery. During my studies, I’ve developed some practices that can be used when analyzing any ancient culture. I hope they may prove useful for the research community.
