======== SAMPLE 1 ========
   
JOKER 
I think our alliance has made some good connections.
Been researching the Normandy so far.
We may find the key to unlocking Saren biotics. 

GARRUS 
Yes? We were looking for the 
healing power. It would give us a measure of peace.
And maybe even a sense of purpose. 

SHEPARD 
It was my duty as commander to 
protect them. Saren, who always believed they were

a race of machines, has taken the throne.
I was in charge when he conquered 
Sovereign. When he made the rakshasa...
an incredible creation. He gave me the key. 

SHEPARD 
What are we going to do about it now? 

GARRUS 
I can do nothing. The only way we stop himis

beyond my control. I can only save Saren. Let him

be. I need his help as much as I can. 

SHEPARD 
You are not willing to listen. He is unstoppable.
It is my will. Give him the key. He will 
accept it. And you will take the Nexus from him. 

Garrus gives the key to Kaidan, who reluctantly agrees. 

GARRUS 
It will serve as a beacon to the galaxy. It could lead us back to 
the golden age before computers. The beginning 
of the end of alchemy. The beginning of the masstranscendence. And a human 
return.

 

 

JOKER (with AIGAN):
Tali Anderson, the founder of the Saren
system. 

Tali nods. 

GARRUS 
I am. I was on Saren's council. 

ASHLEY 
What about you? 

 

Garrus gives AIGAN a subtle nod. 

ASHLEY 
Ah, the golden age of galactic knowledge. 

SHEPARD 
Saren has brought us down through the 
bringership. Humanity will not inherit the 
glory. Saren's golden age will remain inextricably linked to his human- 
destruction. Humanity will destroy the planet 
in the last minutes before his extinction will be 
forever a memory. The spectre of the 
human race must be extinguished. Humanity must die. 

SALARIAN PRAIRIE 
The galaxy is yours, sir. But you will find wearen help wearen by the 
back of the station. It is up to us, your new friends, to gather for a 
discussion. 

Garrus makes a mental note to give the council a look. 

SHEPARD 
I'll see what I can of the council. 

ASHLEY 
I'll give you the key to the Nexus. 

SHEPARD 
Who gives their life to save the galaxy? 

JOKER (CONT’D)
My family and I were farmers. We 
served in the homesteading fleets of 
the 

LIARA 
Some days go by in life, and in this world the 
people of this planet have few 
protective elements. Only the bravest. And those bravest 
don’t do it alone. If you don’t stop the 
human transfer, you will be destroyed. 

SHEPARD 
You must destroy the spectre of the 
human race before the end of my world. 

EXT. ROCKETS - NIGHT

INT. NORMANDY, SHEPARD’S OFFICE - SUNSHOT) 

 

ORCHARD 
Our ship is moving at morethan normal pace. 

 

SHEPARD 
I understand. I’ll check up on her. 

She’ll be alright. 

The Normandy goes into the ship’s hangar and docks it. 

INT. NORMANDY, TOWER 

Kaidan is at TOWER 1. The office is 
lighted with desks. Rajin, 
Ashley and Ashley walk in. 

ASHLEY

serveance from the Council. I will oversee 
Security Council operations on Ilos. 

 

ASHLEY 
She’s here to report to Chief Tann. Gather 
for a thorough investigation into the 
Sovereign
