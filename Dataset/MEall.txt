PROLOGUE: FIND THE BEACON

ACT I
 

SCENE I
The Normandy’s first mass relay trip
 

[The Normandy is travelling in space. The camera follows SHEPARD as they’re entering the Normandy’s CIC.]

 

JOKER (voice-over):

The Arcturus Prime relay is in range. Initiating transmission sequence.

 

[Shepard runs into Corporal Jenkins.]

 

CORPORAL JENKINS:

Commander.

 

[Shepard keeps walking. Navigator Pressly nods at him.]

 

JOKER (voice-over):

We are connected. Calculating transit mass and destination. The relay is hot. Acquiring approach vector. All stations secure for transit.

 

[Shepard walks toward the cockpit as the Normandy gets closer to the mass relay. Shepard enters the cockpit and stands still next to a turian named Nihlus. Both are behind the pilot, Joker.]

 

JOKER (voice-over):

The board is green. Approach run has begun. Hitting the relay in 3...2...1…

 

[We see the Normandy making its first trip through a mass relay.]

 

JOKER:

Thrusters, check. Navigation, check. Internal emissions sink engaged. All systems online. Drift...just under 1500 K.

 

NIHLUS:

1500 is good. Your captain will be pleased.

 

[Nihlus leaves the cockpit. Joker looks at Kaidan, who is sitting next to him, on his right.]

 

JOKER:

I hate that guy.

 

KAIDAN:

Nihlus gave you a compliment...so you hate him?

 

JOKER:

You remember to zip your jumpsuit on the way out of the bathroom? That’s good. I just jumped us halfway across the galaxy and hit a target the size of a pinhead. So that’s incredible. Besides, Spectres are trouble. I don’t like having him on board. Call me paranoid.

 

KAIDAN:

You’re paranoid. The Council helped fund this project. They have a right to send someone to keep an eye on their investment.

 

JOKER:

Yeah, that is the official story. But only an idiot believes the official story.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-I agree

-You’re overreacting

-Cut the chatter!

 

SHEPARD:

They don’t send Spectres on shakedown runs.

 

JOKER:

So there’s more going on here than the captain’s letting on.

 

CAPTAIN ANDERSON (on comm):

Joker. Status report.

 

JOKER:

Just cleared the mass relay, Captain. Stealth systems engaged. Everything looks solid.

 

CAPTAIN ANDERSON (on comm):

Good. Find a comm buoy and link us into the network. I want mission reports relayed back to Alliance brass before we reach Eden Prime.

 

JOKER:

Aye, aye, Captain. Better brace yourself, sir. I think Nihlus is headed your way.

 

CAPTAIN ANDERSON (on comm):

He’s already here, Lieutenant. Tell Commander Shepard to meet me in the comm room for a debriefing.

 

 

JOKER:

You get that, Commander?

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-Is he upset?

-I heard

-You made him mad.

 

SHEPARD:

He sounds angry. Something must have gone wrong with the mission.

 

JOKER:

Pff. Captain always sounds like that when he’s talking to me.

 

KAIDAN:

I can’t possibly imagine why.

 

-> Additional scenes

 

 

SCENE II
Nihlus’s presence on the Normandy
 

[Shepard enters the comm room. Nihlus stops watching a picture of Eden Prime (from the projector in front of him) and turns around to greet Shepard.]

 

NIHLUS:

Commander Shepard. I was hoping you’d get here first. It will give us a chance to talk.


SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-Where’s Captain Anderson?

-Talk?

 

SHEPARD:

The captain said he’d meet me here.

 

NIHLUS:

He’s on his way. I’m interested in this world we’re going to — Eden Prime. I’ve heard it’s quite beautiful.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-Beyond beautiful.

-I wouldn’t know.

-So what?

 

SHEPARD:

They say it’s a paradise.

 

NIHLUS:

Yes... a paradise. Serene. Tranquil. Safe. Eden Prime has become something of a symbol for your people, hasn't it? Proof that humanity can not only establish colonies across the galaxy, but also protect them. But how safe is it, really?

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-Why are you asking?

-What’s your point?

-Is that a threat?

 

SHEPARD:

Do you know something?

 

NIHLUS:

Your people are still newcomers, Shepard. The galaxy can be a very dangerous place. Is the Alliance truly ready for this?

 

[Anderson enters the comm room.]

 

ANDERSON;

I think it’s about time we told the commander what’s really going on.

 

NIHLUS:

This mission is far more than a simple shakedown run.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-I knew it.

-What’s going on?

-That’s obvious.

 

SHEPARD:

I figured there was something you weren’t telling us.

 

ANDERSON:

We’re making a covert pick-up on Eden Prime. That’s why we needed the stealth systems operational.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-Why the secrecy?

-You should have told me.

-What are we picking up?

SHEPARD:

There must be a reason you didn’t tell me about this, sir.

 

 

ANDERSON:

This comes down from the top, Commander. Information strictly on a need-to-know basis. A research team on Eden Prime unearthed some kind of beacon during an excavation. It was Prothean.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-Prothean?

-What are the details?

 

SHEPARD:

I thought the Protheans vanished 50 000 years ago.

 

NIHLUS:

Their legacy still remains. The mass relays, the Citadel, our ship drives -- it's all based on Prothean technology.

 

ANDERSON:

This is big, Shepard. The last time humanity made a discovery like this, it jumped our technology forward two hundred years. But Eden  Prime doesn't have the facilities to handle something like this. We need to bring the beacon back to the Citadel for proper study.

 

NIHLUS:

Obviously, this goes beyond mere human interests, Commander. This discovery could affect every species in Council space.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-Why did we tell the Council?

-I’m glad you’re here to help.

-You sound worried.

-We don’t need your help here.

 

SHEPARD:

Why didn’t we keep the beacon for ourselves?

 

NIHLUS:

You humans don't have the best reputation. Some species see you as selfish. Too unpredictable. Too independent. Even dangerous.

 

ANDERSON:

Sharing that beacon will improve relations with the Council. Plus, we need their scientific expertise. They know more about the Protheans than we do.

 

NIHLUS:

The beacon’s not the only reason I’m here, Shepard.

 

ANDERSON:

Nihlus wants to see you in action, Commander. He’s here to evaluate you.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-I should’ve known.

-Why?

-Like hell he is!

 

SHEPARD:

What’s going on, Captain?

 

ANDERSON:

The Alliance has been pushing for this for a long time. Humanity wants a larger role in shaping interstellar policy. We want more say with the Citadel Council. The Spectres represent the Council’s power and authority. If they accept a human into their ranks, it shows how far the Alliance has come.

 

NIHLUS:

Not many could have survived what you went through on Akuze. You showed a remarkable will to live — a particularly useful talent. That’s why I put your name forward as a candidate for the Spectres.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-You put my name forward?

-You support this, Captain?

-What’s the next step?

-What if I refuse?

 

SHEPARD:

Why would a turian want a human in the Spectres?

 

NIHLUS:

Not all turians resent humanity. Some of us see the potential of your species. We see what you have to offer to the rest of the galaxy... and to the Spectres.

We are an elite group. It's rare to find an individual with the skills we seek. I don't care that you're human, Shepard. I only care that you can do the job.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-You support this, Captain?

-What’s the next step?

-What if I refuse?

 

SHEPARD:

I assume this is good for the Alliance.

ANDERSON:

Earth needs this, Shepard. We’re counting on you.

 

NIHLUS:

I need to see your skills for myself, Commander. Eden Prime will be the first of several missions together.

 

ANDERSON:

You’ll be in charge of the ground team. Secure the beacon and get it onto the ship ASAP. Nihlus will accompany you to observe the mission.

 

SHEPARD - Investigate dialogues options:

-Protheans

-Eden Prime

-Beacons

 

SHEPARD:

What do you know about the Protheans?

 

ANDERSON:

Just what they taught us in school. They were a technologically-advanced species that rules the galaxy 50 000 years ago. Then they vanished. Nobody really knows how or why, though I've heard plenty of theories. But everyone agrees galactic civilization wouldn't exist without them.

 

NIHLUS:

Their Citadel is the very heart of galactic society. And without their mass relays, interstellar travel would be impossible. We all owe the Protheans a great debt.

 

SHEPARD - Investigate dialogues options:

-Protheans

-Eden Prime

-Beacon

 

SHEPARD:

I'd like to know more about Eden Prime before we touch down.

 

ANDERSON:

It's a peaceful farming world, but it represents something much bigger. Eden Prime is one of our oldest and most successful colonies. It proved we were ready to face the challenges of settling new worlds, to forge a place for humanity beyond Earth. It symbolizes humanity's growth and evolution as a spacefaring species. And after this, it will be known as the world where humans made a discovery of galactic importance.

 

SHEPARD - Investigate dialogues options:

-Protheans

-Eden Prime

-Beacon

 

SHEPARD:

Why is this beacon so important?

 

NIHLUS:

All advanced galactic civilization is based on Prothean technology. Even yours.

 

ANDERSON:

If we hadn't discovered those Prothean ruins buried on Mars, we'd still be stuck on Earth. That was just a small data cache. Who knows what we can learn from this beacon? What if it's a weapons archive? We can't let it fall into the wrong hands.

 

SHEPARD:

Like who?

 

ANDERSON:

The Attican Traverse isn't the most stable sector of Citadel space. There are plenty of raiders and criminal groups active in the region. They might figure a Prothean beacon is worth the risk of attacking an Alliance ship. Plus, Eden Prime is right on the border of the Terminus Systems.

 

SHEPARD:

The Attican Traverse is under Citadel protection. If the Terminus Systems attack, it's an act of war.

 

NIHLUS:

Technically, yes. But some of the species in the Terminus might be willing to start a war over this.

 

ANDERSON:

The last thing the Council wants is to get dragged into a major conflict with the Terminus Systems. We have to keep this low-key.

 

SHEPARD:

Just give the word, Captain.

 

ANDERSON:

We should be getting close to Eden —

 

JOKER (voice-over):

Captain! We’ve got a problem.

 

ANDERSON:

What’s wrong, Joker?

JOKER (voice-over):

Transmission from Eden Prime, sir. You better see this!

 

ANDERSON:

Bring it up on screen.

 

[Shepard, Anderson, and Nihlus look at the screen.]

 

ON SCREEN:

Alliance members are under attack. A soldier (Ashley Williams) get close to the screen.

 

ASHLEY:

GET DOWN!

 

[The camera shows her firing at an unseen enemy, followed by images of a ship.]

 

OFFICIER:

We are under attack! Taking heavy casualties. I repeat: heavy casualties! We can’t…argh!

--eed evac! They came out of nowhere. We need —

 

The officer gets hurt by an unseen enemy. Other soldiers stare astonished at a ship. The camera shows its image and is followed by a grey screen.

 

JOKER (voice-over):

Everything cuts out after that. No comm traffic at all. Just goes dead. There’s nothing.

 

ANDERSON:

Reverse and hold at 38.5.

 

[Anderson and Nihlus stare at the image of the ship on the screen.]

 

ANDERSON:

Status report.

 

JOKER (voice-over):

Seventeen minutes out, Captain. No other Alliance ships in the area.

 

ANDERSON:

Take us in, Joker. Fast and quiet. This mission just got a lot more complicated.

 

NIHLUS:

A small strike team can move quickly without drawing attention. It’s our best chance to secure the beacon.

 

[Shepard stares at the image of the ship on the screen.]

 

ANDERSON (to Nihlus):

Grab your gear and meet us in the cargo hold.

 

[Nihlus walks toward the exit.]

 

ANDERSON (to Shepard):

Tell Alenko and Jenkins to suit up, Commander. You’re going in.

 

[The image of the ship on the screen is shown one last time.]

 

SCENE III
Mission Briefing
[The Normandy is headed to Eden Prime.]

 

JOKER (voice-over):

Engaging stealth systems.

 

[The Normandy reaches Eden Prime.]

 

JOKER (voice-over):

Somebody was doing some serious digging here, Captain.

 

[Anderson briefs Shepard, Kaidan, and Jenkins before the mission in the Normandy’s cargo bay. Nihlus is present as well.]

 

ANDERSON:

Your team’s the muscle in this operation, Commander. Go in heavy and head straight for the dig site.

 

KAIDAN:

What about survivors, Captain?

 

ANDERSON:

Helping survivors is a secondary objective. The beacon’s your top priority.

 

JOKER (voice-over):

Approaching drop point one.

 

JENKINS:

Nihlus, you’re coming with us?

 

NIHLUS:

I move faster on my own.

 

[Nihlus leaves the Normandy.]

 

ANDERSON:

Nihlus will scout out ahead. He’ll feed you status reports throughout the mission; otherwise, I want radio silence.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-He can count on us.

-Can we trust him?

-Understood, Captain.

 

SHEPARD:

We’ve got his back, Captain.

 

ANDERSON:

The mission’s yours now, Shepard. Good luck.

 

[The Normandy lands on Eden Prime.]

 

JOKER (voice-over):

We are approaching drop point two.

 

ACT II
 

SCENE I
Situation on the ground
[Shepard, Jenkins, and Kaidan are the squad on the ground.]

 

NIHLUS (on comm):

This place got hit hard, Commander. Hostiles everywhere. Keep your guard up.

 

[As the squad moves, they see strange looking forms moving around them.]

 

KAIDAN:

What the hell are those?

 

JENKINS:

Gas bags. Don’t worry — they’re harmless.

 

[They see burned corpses on the ground.]

 

JENKINS:

Oh god. What happened here?

 

KAIDAN:

Smells like smoke and death.

 

[Shepard makes signs to position the squad. Jenkins goes past a corner and gets hit by multiple geth recon drones. Shepard and Kaidan destroy the drones. They reach Jenkins next. He’s dead. Kaidan closes his eyes.]

 

KAIDAN:

Ripped right through his shields. Never had a chance.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-He deserves a burial.

-We can’t help him now.

-Forget about him.

 

SHEPARD:

We’ll see that he receives a proper service once the mission is complete. But I need you to stay focused.

 

KAIDAN:

Aye, aye, sir.

 

[Kaidan and Shepard keep walking.They fight more geth recon drones.]

 

NIHLUS (on comm):

I’ve got some burned out buildings here, Shepard. A lot of bodies. I’m going to check it out. I’ll try to catch up with you at the dig site.

 

[Still in Eden Prime. Cuts to Ashley Williams, thrown on the ground. She gets her weapon and shoots geth recon drones. In front of her, geth spikes rise from the ground to pierce humans, who remain stuck on the ends up in the air. Ashley runs and finds cover. The geth walk toward her. Shepard and Kaidan arrive and shoot the geth troopers. Once they’re alone and safe, Ashley stands in front of them.]

 

ASHLEY:

Thanks for your help, Commander. I didn’t think I was going to make it. Gunnery Chief Ashley Williams of the 212. You the one in charge here, sir?

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-Are you okay?

-What happened here?

-We’re on a mission.

 

SHEPARD:

Are you wounded, Williams?

 

ASHLEY:

A few scrapes and burns. Nothing serious. The others weren’t so lucky. Oh man… We were patrolling the perimeter when the attack hit. We tried to get off a distress call, but they cut off our communications. I’ve been fighting for my life ever since.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-What happened to your unit?

-Fighting these things?

 

SHEPARD:

Where’s the rest of your squad?

 

ASHLEY:

We tried to double back to the beacon. But we walked into an ambush. I don’t think any of the others…. I think I’m the only one left.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-Don’t blame yourself.

-You abandoned them.

-What killed them?

 

SHEPARD:

This isn’t your fault, Williams. You couldn’t have done anything to save them.

 

ASHLEY:

Yes, sir. We held our position as long as we could. Until the geth overwhelmed us.

 

KAIDAN:

The geth haven’t been seen outside the Veil in nearly 200 years. Why are they here now?

 

ASHLEY:

They must have come for the beacon. The dig site is close. Just over that rise. It might still be there.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-Join us.

-Take us there.

-Stay there.

 

SHEPARD:

We could use your help, Williams.

 

ASHLEY:

Aye, aye, sir. It’s time for payback.

 

SHEPARD - Investigate dialogues options:

-Geth

-Beacon

-Before the attack

-Nihlus

 

SHEPARD:

What else do you know about the geth?

 

ASHLEY:

Just what I remember from history class back in school. They’re synthetics. Non-organic life-forms with limited AI programming created by the quarians a few centuries ago. They were supposed to be a source of cheap labor, but ended up turning on the quarians and drove them into exile. After that, they just kind of disappeared behind the Perseus Veil. Nobody's really heard much from them since.

 

SHEPARD - Investigate dialogues options:

-Geth

-Beacon

-Before the attack

-Nihlus

 

SHEPARD:

Tell me everything you know about the beacon.

 

ASHLEY:

They were doing some digging out here to extend the monorail and expand the colony. A few weeks ago they unearthed some Prothean ruins...and the beacon. Suddenly, every scientific expert in the colony was interested. That’s when they brought us in to secure the site. I don’t know much about the beacon itself. But I heard one of the researchers say this could be the biggest scientific discovery of the century.

 

 

SHEPARD:

Describe what happened leading up to the attack.

 

ASHLEY:

We were sent out a couple nights ago from the main colony to secure the area. Seemed like a routine patrol until the geth hit us. We never knew they were coming.

 

SHEPARD:

What happened to the researchers at the dig site?

 

ASHLEY:

I don't know. They set up camp near the beacon. The 232 was with them. Maybe their unit fared better than mine.

 

SHEPARD - Investigate dialogues options:

-Geth

-Beacon

-Before the attack

-Nihlus

 

SHEPARD:

Have you seen a turian Spectre around here?

 

ASHLEY:

There aren’t any turians on Eden Prime. None that I’ve ever met. Not sure I’d be able to tell if one was a Spectre, anyway.

 

 

KAIDAN:

If you saw this guy, you’d know. Carries enough firepower to wipe out a whole platoon. Luckily, he’s on our side.

 

ASHLEY:

Sorry. Like I said, no turians.

 

SHEPARD:

Move out!

 

[Ashley nods. She joins the squad. The three of them walk toward the dig site.]

 

ASHLEY:

The beacon’s at the far end of this trench.

 

KAIDAN:

Eden Prime will never be the same again. That man was still alive when they stuck him on the spike.

 

ASHLEY:

Killing us isn’t enough. The geth want us to suffer. Impaling victims instead of just shooting them...there must be some reason behind it.

 

KAIDAN:

Classic psychological warfare. They’re using terror as a weapon.

 

[They arrive at the dig site, where geth troopers wait for them. The squad kills them.]

 

ASHLEY:

This is the dig site. The beacon was right here. It must have been moved.

 

KAIDAN:

By who? Our side? Or the geth?

 

ASHLEY:

Hard to say. Maybe we’ll know more after we check out the research camp.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-Any survivors?

-Let’s go there.

-We’re wasting time.

 

SHEPARD:

You think anyone got out of here alive?

 

 

 

ASHLEY:

If they were lucky. Maybe hiding up in the camp. It’s just at the top of this ridge. Up the ramps.

 

NIHLUS (voice-over):

Change of plans, Shepard. There’s a small spaceport up ahead. I want to check it out. I’ll wait for you there.

 

[The squad walks toward the camp.]

 

ASHLEY:

Looks like they hit the camp hard.

 

KAIDAN:

It’s a good place for an ambush. Keep your guard up.

 

[Spikes (with pierced husks at the center) are being lowered.]

 

KAIDAN:

Oh, god! They’re still alive!

 

ASHLEY:

What did the geth do to them?

 

[The squad kills the husks.]

 

ASHLEY:

It must take a few hours for the spikes to turn people into husks.

 

KAIDAN:

Now we know what those spikes are for: turning our own dead against us.

 

[They find a shack.]

 

ASHLEY:

That door. It’s closed. Security lock’s engaged.

 

[Shepard begins decrypting and the doors opens. Inside are a man and a woman.]

 

DR. WARREN:

Humans! Thank the Maker!

 

MANUEL:

Hurry! Close the door! Before they come back!

 

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-You’re safe.

-Who are you?

-Tell me what happened.

 

SHEPARD:

Don’t worry. We’ll protect you.

 

DR. WARREN:

Thank you. I think we’ll be okay now. It looks like everyone’s gone.

 

ASHLEY:

You’re Dr. Warren, the one in charge of the excavation. Do you know what happened to the beacon?

 

DR. WARREN:

It was moved to the spaceport this morning. Manuel and I stayed behind to help pack up the camp. When the attack came, the marines held them off long enough for us to hide. They gave their lives to save us.

 

MANUEL:

No one is saved. The age of humanity is ended. Soon, only ruin and corpses will remain.

SHEPARD - Investigate dialogues options:

-Beacon

-Assistant

 

SHEPARD:

What else can you tell me about the attack?

 

DR. WARREN:

It all happened so fast. One second we were gathering up our equipment. The next we were hiding in the shed while the geth swarmed over the camp.

 

MANUEL:

Agents of the destroyers. Bringers of darkness. Heralds of our extinction.

 

DR. WARREN:

We could hear the battle outside. Gunfire. Screams. I thought it would never end. Then, everything went quiet. We just sat there, too afraid to move. Until you came along.

 

SHEPARD - Investigate dialogues options:

-Attack

-Nihlus

-Beacon

-Assistant

 

SHEPARD:

Did you notice a turian in the area?

 

MANUEL:

I saw him. The prophet. Leader of the enemy. He was here, before the attack.

 

KAIDAN:

That’s impossible. Nihlus was with us on the Normandy before the attack. He couldn’t have been here.

 

DR. WARREN:

I’m sorry. Manuel’s still a bit...unsettled. We haven’t seen your turian. We’ve been hiding in here since the attack.

-Assistant

 

SHEPARD:

Can you tell me anything about the beacon?

 

DR. WARREN:

It’s some type of data module from a galaxy-wide communications network. Remarkably well-preserved. It could be the greatest scientific discovery of our lifetime! Miraculous new technologies. Groundbreaking medical advances. Who knows what secrets are locked inside?

 

MANUEL:

We have unearthed the heart of evil. Awakened the beast. Unleashed the darkness.

 

DR. WARREN:

Manuel! Please! This isn’t the time.

 

SHEPARD - Investigate dialogues options:

-Attack

-Assistant

 

SHEPARD:

What’s wrong with your assistant?

 

DR. WARREN:

Manuel has a brilliant mind, but he’s always been a bit...unstable. Genius and madness are two sides of the same coin.

 

MANUEL:

Is it madness to see the future? To see the destruction rushing towards us? To understand there is no escape? No hope? No, I am not mad. I’m the only sane one left!

 

DR. WARREN:

I gave him an extra dose of his meds after the attack.

 

SHEPARD (to Ashley):

Williams, take us to the spaceport.

 

MANUEL:

You can’t stop it. Nobody can stop it. Night is falling. The darkness of eternity.

 

DR. WARREN:

Hush, Manuel. Go lie down. You’ll feel better once the medication kicks in.

 

[The squad leaves.]

 

SCENE II
The spaceport
 

[Cuts to Nihlus, near the spaceport. He takes cover only to emerge seconds later, aiming his weapon at a nearby turian. He lowers his weapon when he recognizes Saren.]

 

NIHLUS:

Saren?

 

SAREN:

Nihlus.

 

NIHLUS:

This isn’t your mission, Saren. What are you doing here?

 

[Saren walks toward Nihlus and puts a hand on his shoulder.]

 

SAREN:

The Council thought you could use some help on this one.

 

[Saren gets behind Nihlus, whose back is turned.]

 

NIHLUS:

I wasn’t expecting to find the geth here. The situation’s bad.

 

[Saren points a gun at Nihlus.]

 

SAREN:

Don’t worry. I’ve got it under control.

 

[The squad catches up and is now near the spaceport. In the sky there is a large ship looming.]

 

KAIDAN:

What is that? Off in the distance.

 

ASHLEY:

It’s a ship. Look at the size of it!

 

[The ship slowly enters the atmosphere. The squad keeps walking and fights geth troopers on the way to the spaceport. There is a shack. Shepard decrypts the lock to open the door.]

 

COLE:

Everybody stay calm out there. We’re coming out. We’re not armed.

 

[Two men and a woman come outside.]

 

FARMER:

Is it safe? Are they gone?

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-It’s safe.

-They’re gone.

-Stop right there!

 

SHEPARD:

You’re okay now. Nobody’s going to hurt you.

 

COLE:

Those things were crawling all around the shed. They would have found us for sure. We owe you our lives.

 

FARMER:

I — I still can’t believe it. When we saw that ship I thought it was all over!

 

COLE:

It showed up right before the attack. Knew it was trouble the second I saw it. So we made a break for the sheds.

 

SHEPARD - Investigate dialogues options:

-Attack details

-Beacon

-Ship

 

SHEPARD:

Tell me everything you remember about the attack.

 

COLE:

The three of us were working the crops when that ship showed up. We just saw it and ran. I don’t know what happened to the rest of the crew.

 

BLAKE:

They were by the garage. Over near the spaceport. Right where that ship came down. No way they survived.

 

FARMER:

You don’t know that! We survived. If they made it to the garage, they could’ve had a fighting chance!

 

SHEPARD - Investigate dialogues options:

-Attack details

-Beacon

-Ship

 

SHEPARD:

Do you know anything about the Prothean beacon they dug up?

 

COLE:

We’re just farmers. We heard they found something out there, but it never really mattered to us. Not until now.

 

SHEPARD - Investigate dialogues options:

-Attack details

-Beacon

-Ship

 

SHEPARD:

What else can you tell me about the ship you saw?

 

COLE:

I was too busy running to get a clear look at it. I think it landed over near the spaceport.

 

FARMER:

Tell them about the noise, Cole. That awful noise.

 

COLE:

It was emitting some kind of signal as it descended. Sounded like the shriek of the damned. Only it was coming from inside your own head.

 

SHEPARD:

It was probably trying to block communications.

 

COLE:

Whatever it was, felt like it was tearing right through my skull. Almost made it impossible to think.

 

SHEPARD:

I have to go.

 

BLAKE:

Hey, Cole. We’re just a bunch of farmers. These guys are soldiers. Maybe we should give them the stuff.

 

COLE:

Geez, Blake. You gotta learn when to shut up.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-You should come clean.

-What's going on?

-I don't like being lied to.

SHEPARD:

You have something to tell me, Cole?

 

COLE:

Some guys at the spaceport were running a small smuggling ring. Nothing major. In exchange for a cut of the profits, we let them store packages in our sheds.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-Smuggling's a crime.

-Like what?

-That's why you ran here!

 

SHEPARD:

You’re breaking the law, Cole.

 

COLE:

We’re not hurting anybody! Hell, most of the time, I don’t even know what’s in the packages. I just thought there might be something we could use. I found a pistol. Figured it would come in handy if those things came back. But you’ll probably get more use out of it than we will.

 

PARAGON option: Is that all?

RENEGADE OPTION: You’re holding out on me!

 

SHEPARD:

We’re risking our lives to save this colony. You sure there’s nothing else in here that could help us out?

 

COLE:

Yeah, there’s one more thing. I was going to sell it after this was over. But you probably deserve it more than I do.

 

[Cole hands it over to Shepard.]

 

ASHLEY:

Who’s your contact at the spaceport, Cole? What’s his name?

 

COLE:

He’s not a bad guy. I don’t want to get him in trouble. Besides, I’m not a snitch!

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-He may know something.

-Fine.

-Is he worth dying for?

 

SHEPARD:

He might have something to do with this whole attack, Cole. We need his name. It’s important.

 

COLE:

Yeah, okay. You’re right. His name’s Powell. Works at the docks at the spaceport. If he’s still alive.

 

SHEPARD:

I have to go.

 

COLE:

Good luck.

 

[The squad reaches the open space of the spaceport where they find Nihlus’s corpse.]

 

KAIDAN:

Commander. It’s Nihlus.

 

ASHLEY:

Something’s moving! Over behind those crates!

 

[Kaidan and Shepard aim their gun at where Ashley is pointing. A man walks toward them, hands in the air.]

 

POWELL:

Wait! Don’t — don’t shoot! I’m one of you! I’m human.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-You need to be more careful.

-Who are you?

-You’re a coward?

 

 

SHEPARD:

Sneaking up on us like that nearly got you killed!

 

POWELL:

I...I’m sorry. I was hiding. From those creatures. My name’s Powell. I saw what happened to that turian. The other one shot him.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-Tell me what happened.

-It wasn’t the geth?

-Other one?

 

SHEPARD:

I need to know how Nihlus died.

 

POWELL:

The other one got here first. He was waiting when your friend showed up. He called him Saren. I think they knew each other. Your friend seemed to relax. He let his guard down...and Saren killed him. Shot him right in the back. I’m just lucky he didn’t see me behind the crates.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-What about the beacon?

-Then what?

 

SHEPARD:

We were told a Prothean beacon was brought to the spaceport. What happened to it?

 

POWELL:

It’s over on the other platform. Probably where that guy Saren was headed. We hopped on the cargo train right after he killed your friend. I knew that beacon was trouble. Everything’s gone to hell since we found it. First that damn mother ship showed up. Then the attack. They killed everyone. Everyone! If I hadn’t been behind the crates I’d be dead, too!

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-The geth didn’t find you?

-Cole mentioned you.

 

SHEPARD:

You’re Cole’s contact here on the docks. For the smuggling ring.

 

POWELL:

What? No! I mean...what does it matter now? So I’m a smuggler? Who cares? My supervisor’s dead. The entire crew’s dead. It doesn’t matter now, does it?

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-Smuggle any weapons?

-You’re right.

 

SHEPARD:

Anything hidden nearby that we could use against the geth?

 

POWELL:

A shipment of grenades came through last week. Nobody notices if a few small pieces go missing from the military orders.

 

ASHLEY:

You greedy son of a bitch! We’re out here trying to protect your sorry ass and all you can think about is how you can rip us off?!

 

POWELL:

I never thought you’d actually need those grenades! Who’d want to attack Eden Prime? We’re just a bunch of farmers! How was I supposed to know?

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-Let it go, Williams.

-Hand them over.

-You’re pathetic!

 

SHEPARD:

Just give me the grenades.

 

POWELL:

They’re yours. Take them. My smuggling days are over. I swear.

 

PARAGON option: You should make amends.

RENEGADE option: Is that all?

 

SHEPARD:

A lot of marines died here, Powell. Those grenades could have come in handy. If I were you, I’d think of some way to make it up to them.

 

POWELL:

Yeah. Okay. There is something else I was saving. Could be worth a fortune. Experimental technology. Top of the line. Take it. I don’t need it. I didn’t want anyone to get hurt. Really. I’m sorry.

 

[Powell gives Shepard the item.]

 

SHEPARD - Investigate dialogues options:

-Attack

-Beacon

-Ship

 

 

SHEPARD:

Tell me about the geth attack.

 

POWELL:

It was quick. One minute, that ship was descending. The next, those geth were swarming over the platform, thousands of them. They must have been inside that mother ship. They shot anything that moved. It was a massacre.

 

SHEPARD:

How come you’re the only one who survived? Why didn’t anyone else try to hide behind the crates?

POWELL:

They never had a chance. I...I was already behind the crates when the attack started.

 

KAIDAN:

Wait a minute. You were hiding behind the crates before the attack?

POWELL:

I...sometimes I need a nap to get through my shift. I sneak off behind the crates to grab forty winks where the supervisor can’t find me.

ASHLEY:

You survived because you’re lazy?

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-Lucky break for you.

-You make me sick.

 

SHEPARD:

If you hadn't snuck off for that nap you'd probably be dead just like all the others.

 

POWELL:

Yeah. Yeah, I guess. I don't really want to think about it.

 

SHEPARD - Investigate dialogues options:

-Attack

-Beacon

-Ship

 

SHEPARD:

Is there anything else you can tell me about the beacon?

 

POWELL:

They brought it here this morning. We loaded it up onto the train and shipped it to the other platform. Hard to believe that was only a few hours ago. Feels like a whole other life.

 

SHEPARD - Investigate dialogues options:

-Attack

-Beacon

-Ship

 

SHEPARD:

Tell me about this ‘mother ship’ you saw.

 

POWELL:

I’ve never seen anything like it before. It — it was huge. Landed over near that platform. The whole place got dark as it came down. And — and it was making this noise, this — this sound that bored right into your brain. That’s what woke me up. The attack came a few minutes later.

 

SHEPARD:

We need to find that beacon before it’s too late.

 

POWELL:

Take the cargo train. That’s where the other turian went. I...I can’t stay here. I need to get away from all this.

 

SCENE III
Finding the beacon
 

[The squad walks toward the cargo train. They kill geth troopers and destroyers on the way.  The cargo train takes them to the site where the beacon is. Saren is already there.]

 

SAREN (to geth):

Set the charges. Destroy the entire colony. Leave no evidence that we were here.

 

[Saren gets close to the beacon, which emits a green light. He receives a vision and is floating in the air. The geth are activating four bombs around the site. Shepard and the squad gets out of the cargo train.]

 

KAIDAN:

Demolition charges! The geth must have planted them.

 

ASHLEY:

Hurry! We need to find them all and shut them down.

 

[They deactivate the bombs while being attacked by geth troopers. On their way to the beacon, the squad destroys husks.]

 

SHEPARD (on comm):

Normandy, the beacon is secure. Request immediate evac.

 

KAIDAN:

This is amazing. Actual working Prothean technology. Unbelievable!

 

ASHLEY:

It wasn’t doing anything like that when they dug it up.

 

KAIDAN:

Something must have activated it.

 

SHEPARD (on comm):

Roger, Normandy. Standing by.

 

[Ashley gets close to the beacon. It starts emitting a vibrant green light. Shepard sees her and rushes to get her out of the way. Kaidan takes Ashley in his arms.]

 

ASHLEY:

Shepard!

 

[Kaidan prevents her from moving.]

 

KAIDAN:

No! Don’t touch him! It’s too dangerous!

 

[Shepard is now floating in the air. He’s receiving a vision from the beacon, and a series of images appear on the screen. Finally, the vision ends, and he’s back on the ground. Ashley and Kaidan rush toward him.]

 

SCENE IV
Saren and Benezia
[The ship on Eden Prime is now travelling in space. Saren is sitting, his back turned. Matriarch Benezia, an asari, walks toward him.]

 

MATRIARCH BENEZIA:

We identified the ship that touched down on Eden Prime. The Normandy. A human Alliance vessel. It was under the command of Captain Anderson. They managed to save the colony.

 

SAREN:

And the beacon?

 

MATRIARCH BENEZIA:

One of the humans may have used it.

 

SAREN:

Argh! Rarh! Argh!

 

[Saren throws objects around in a fit of rage. Matriarch Benezia moves her head so as not to get hit by an object thrown at her. He rushes toward her and puts her head in his hands.]

 

SAREN:

This human must be eliminated.

 

[He lets go of her and leaves while she stares at him.]

 

SCENE V
Post mission debriefing
 

[Shepard wakes up in the Normandy’s med bay.]

 

ASHLEY:

Doctor? Doctor Chakwas? I think he’s waking up.

 

[Shepard sits on the bed while Chakwas comes to see him. Ashley is behind them.]

 

CHAKWAS:

You had us worried there, Shepard. How are you feeling?

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-I’m okay.

-What happened?

-Not great.

 

SHEPARD:

Minor throbbing. Nothing serious. How long was I out?

 

CHAKWAS:

About fifteen hours. Something happened down there with the beacon, I think.

 

ASHLEY:

It’s my fault. I must have triggered some kind of security field when I approached it. You had to push me out of the way.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-Don’t blame yourself.

-What about the beacon?

-You were careless.

 

SHEPARD:

You had no way to know what would happen.

 

[Ashley appears relieved and pleased.]

 

CHAKWAS:

Actually, we don’t even know if that’s what set it off. Unfortunately, we’ll never get the chance to find out.

 

ASHLEY:

The beacon exploded. A system overload, maybe. The blast knocked you cold. The Lieutenant and I carried you back here to the ship.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-Thanks.

-Was I hurt?

-Not a local hospital?

 

SHEPARD:

I appreciate it.

 

[Ashley appears pleased.]

 

CHAKWAS:

Physically, you’re fine. But I detected some unusual brain activity, abnormal beta waves. I also noticed an increase in your rapid eye movement, signs typically associated with intense dreaming.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-I was dreaming.

-Not a dream. A vision.

-More like a nightmare.

 

SHEPARD:

I saw — I’m not sure what I saw. Death. Destruction. Nothing’s really clear.

 

CHAKWAS:

Hmmm. I better add this to my report. It may — Oh, Captain Anderson.

 

[Anderson joins the group in the med bay.]

 

ANDERSON:

How’s our XO holding up, Doctor?

 

CHAKWAS:

All the readings look normal. I’d say the commander’s going to be fine.

 

ANDERSON:

Glad to hear it. Shepard, I need to speak with you — in private.

 

[Ashley salutes Anderson.]

 

ASHLEY:

Aye, aye, Captain. I’ll be in the mess if you need me.

 

[Ashley and Chakwas leave the med bay.]

 

ANDERSON:

Sounds like that beacon hit you pretty hard, Commander. You sure you’re okay?

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-I feel bad about Jenkins.

-Why is Williams here?

-I'm pissed off about the geth.

-I’m fine.

 

SHEPARD:

I don’t like soldiers dying under my command.

 

ANDERSON:

Jenkins wasn’t your fault. You did a good job, Shepard.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-I feel bad about Jenkins.

-Why is Williams here?

-I'm pissed off about the geth.

-You wanted to talk?

 

SHEPARD:

Chief Williams isn’t part of the Normandy crew.

 

ANDERSON:

I figured we could use a soldier like her. She's been reassigned to the Normandy.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-Good.

-That's a mistake.

-You wanted to talk?

 

SHEPARD:

Williams is a good soldier. She deserves it.

 

 

ANDERSON:

Lieutenant Alenko agrees with you. That's why I added her to our crew.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-I feel bad about Jenkins.

-I'm pissed off about the geth.

-You wanted to talk?

 

SHEPARD:

Intel dropped the ball, sir. We had no idea what we were walking into down there. That’s why things went to hell.

 

ANDERSON:

The geth haven’t been outside the Veil in two centuries, Commander. Nobody could have predicted this.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-I feel bad about Jenkins.

-I'm pissed off about the geth.

-You wanted to talk?

 

SHEPARD:

You said you needed to see me in private, Captain?

 

ANDERSON:

I won’t lie to you, Shepard. Things look bad. Nihlus is dead. The beacon was destroyed and geth are invading. The Council’s going to want answers.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-We've got nothing to hide.

-I did my job.

-To hell with them!

 

SHEPARD:

I didn’t do anything wrong, Captain. Hopefully, the Council can see that.

 

ANDERSON:

I’ll stand behind you and your report, Shepard. You’re a damned hero in my books. That’s not why I’m here. It’s Saren, that other turian. Saren’s a Spectre, one of the best. A living legend. But if he’s working with the geth, it means he’s gone rogue. A rogue Spectre’s trouble. Saren’s dangerous. And he hates humans.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-Hates humans?

-He wanted the beacon.

 

SHEPARD:

Why?

 

ANDERSON:

He thinks we’re growing too fast, taking over the galaxy. A lot of aliens think that way. Most of them don’t do anything about it. But Saren has allied himself with the geth. I don’t know how. I don’t know why. I only know it had something to do with that beacon. You were there just before the beacon self-destructed. Did you see anything? Any clue that might tell us what Saren was after?

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-I’m not sure.

-A vision.

 

SHEPARD:

Just before I lost consciousness, I had some kind of vision.

 

ANDERSON:

A vision? A vision of what?

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-A warning.

-War.

-Our death.

 

SHEPARD:

I saw synthetics. Geth, maybe. Slaughtering people. Butchering them.

 

ANDERSON:

We need to report this to the Council, Shepard.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-What will we say?

-There’s nothing to report.

-Forget it!

 

SHEPARD:

What are we going to tell them? I had a bad dream?

 

ANDERSON:

We don’t know what information was stored in that beacon. Lost Prothean technology? Blueprints for some ancient weapon of mass destruction? Whatever it was, Saren took it. But I know Saren. I know his reputation, his politics. He believes humans are a blight on the galaxy. This attack was an act of war! He has the secrets from the beacon. He has an army of geth at his command. And he won’t stop until he’s wiped humanity from the face of the galaxy!

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-You’re right.

-I’ll stop him.

-Not if I can help it!

 

SHEPARD:

I’ll find some way to take him down.

 

ANDERSON:

It’s not that easy. He’s a Spectre. He can go anywhere, do almost anything. That’s why we need the Council on our side.

 

SHEPARD - dialogues options:

-Understood, sir!

-We expose him.

-They can’t help us!

 

SHEPARD:

We prove Saren’s gone rogue and the Council will revoke his Spectre status.

 

ANDERSON:

I’ll contact the ambassador and see if he can get us an audience with the Council. He’ll want to see us as soon as we reach the Citadel. We should be getting close. Head up to the bridge and tell Joker to bring us into dock.

PLANETSIDE

ACT I
 

SCENE I
BRIEFING
 

[Ryder, Liam and Cora joins Captain Dunn on the Hyperion bridge as the Hyperion prepares to dock at the Nexus.]

 

CAPTAIN DUNN:

Ryder, good to see you on your feet. We’re at the Nexus. It’s the forward hub for the entire Andromeda Initiative. The asari, salarian, and turian arks should be there, too.

 

[The Hyperion is flying toward the Nexus, which can be seen from afar.]

 

RYDER:

Let’s hope they’ve had better luck.

 

LANI:

Starting our approach now.

 

LIAM:

It’s almost as big as the Citadel back home.

 

LANI:

Nexus control, this is Ark Hyperion requesting docking clearance.

 

[The Nexus can be seen from up close. The Hyperion seems incredibly small compared to it.]

 

LANI:

Captain, I’m only getting their automated approach channel, not a live person.

 

CAPTAIN DUNN:

Well, like it or not, we’re here. Take us in.

 

[They all watch as the Hyperion docks. The Nexus appears to be under construction, with large parts of it not built.]

 

CORA:

Construction should’ve been finished by now.

 

LIAM:

Could be worse…

 

RYDER:

How? Habitat 7’s a bust, we might’ve started a war with the first aliens we met, and our Pathfinder’s dead. This better be rock bottom.

 

LANI:

Green across the board. Docking initiated.

 

[The Hyperion finishes docking.]

 

CAPTAIN DUNN:

All right. I got us here. Good luck, Pathfinder.

 

[Ryder, Cora, and Liam leave the Bridge.]

 

CORA:

You going to be okay, Ryder?

 

RYDER:

The Captain just called me "Pathfinder." This is really happening.

 

LIAM:

Just take a deep breath.

 

RYDER:

I still can't believe Dad's dead. This should've been his moment.

 

CORA:

But now it's yours. You just need to decide what you're going to do with it.

 

RYDER:

Where do I start? I'm just not sure I'm ready.

 

LIAM:

We weren't ready to fall out of the sky on Habitat 7. But we survived that.

 

RYDER:

Right. So, always keep a jump-jet handy.

 

[Ryder, Cora, and Liam walk away from the bridge. Two crew members are talking in front of a console.]

 

CREW 1:

I need engineering to secure all connections from the ark to the Nexus.

 

 

CREW 2:

What's the priority?

 

CREW 1:

Start running power and data links first. Then move to secondary comm traffic.

 

CREW 2:

Got it. I'll follow up with their engineers later.

 

[They reach the next room.]

 

CREW 1:

Captain wants to see a full duty roster.

 

CREW 2:

I just updated the charts.

 

CREW 1:

She'll want to see crew reassignments first. Start with non-essential personnel.

 

[They’re close to the tram. A man is addressing crew members outside. Ryder pauses to listen.]

 

CREW 1:

Okay folks, this is what we've been waiting for. Let your teams know that docking procedures are now in effect. We've got 20.000 colonists still asleep, and we'll need somewhere to put them when the alarm clock goes off. As soon as we get clearance from the Nexus, we'll be following statis revival protocols. We want to avoid any log jams, so it's vital your teams coordinate with each other and keep people moving. Any questions so far?

 

CREW 2:

How do we handle deaths that occurred in transit?

 

CREW 1:

Right. It's an unfortunate fact that not everyone will have survived the voyage. We've already got scattered reports of medical problems from that dark energy cloud we hit. If somebody didn't make it, check with the medical officer. We'll see about notifying their next of kin. I'm hoping it's a rare exception. Also, try to keep it quiet. Andromeda is all about new beginnings, not holding funerals.

 

[Ryder, Liam, and Cora board the tram.]

 

 

SCENE II
Entering the Nexus
 

[The tram is on its way to the Nexus.]

 

RYDER (VOICE-OVER):

It'll be nice to see some friendly faces this time.

 

CORA (VOICE-OVER):

The Nexus runs a support crew. Just enough to finish building the station and provide safe harbor for the arks.

 

[Inside the tram, Cora and Liam are on either side of the tram’s door. Cora is using her omni-tool.]

 

RYDER:

Means we can start waking our people up.

 

LIAM:

They built a bar, right? Gotta have champagne for the welcome party.

 

RYDER:

You're expecting one?

 

LIAM:

After what we've been through, I could use a buzz.

 

RYDER:

We all could.

 

LIAM:

Yeah. Rough ride so far.

 

CORA:

We'll bounce back. Real food and a shower are just ahead.

 

[The tram stops and the door opens to the Nexus’ Common Area.]

 

CORA:

Here we are.

 

[They step out of the tram and enter the Common Area. It’s dark and appears empty.]

 

LIAM:

Uh... I don't see any champagne.

 

RYDER:

Where is everybody? Well, this can't be right.

 

CORA:

It's like everything's on standby.

 

LIAM:

If it's a surprise party, they're doing an awfully good job of it.

 

[Plants are in the middle of the area in a sublevel platform. In front of them is Avina, an asari-looking VI emitting a faint blue light.]

 

RYDER:

Plants are still alive.

 

CORA:

We could see what the VI has to say.

 

[Ryder activates Avina.]

 

AVINA:

Welcome to the Nexus, gateway to Andromeda. I'm Avina, a virtual intelligence designed to assist you with immigration.

 

LIAM:

Can you tell us where the welcome party is hiding?

 

AVINA:

I'm sorry. My code is limited to information and simple interaction simulations. Please select from the following pre-programmed responses.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Immigration

-Andromeda Galaxy

-The Nexus

-Living arrangements

-Current year

 

RYDER:

How does the immigration process work?

 

AVINA:

We ask that you submit to a brief medical exam to ensure your health and well-being after making such a long journey. Once you've been cleared, our colonization experts will assist you in finding your new home. Please be mindful of the queue: thousands of eager colonists like you are waiting to begin their new life in Andromeda!

 

LIAM:

Uh... where? Place is deserted.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Immigration

-Andromeda Galaxy

-The Nexus

-Living arrangements

-Current year

 

RYDER:

What can you tell me about the Andromeda Galaxy?

 

AVINA:

Here in Andromeda, you are over two million-light years away from the Milky Way Galaxy. This is the furthest any lifeform has ever traveled outside our home system, making you a brave pioneer, indeed. The Nexus itself is located in a region known as the Heleus Cluster. Here, you and thousands of your fellow colonists will fulfill your dreams of settling a new home. Fortune awaits!

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Immigration

-Andromeda Galaxy

-The Nexus

-Living arrangements

-Current year

 

RYDER:

What is the Nexus?

 

AVINA:

The Nexus serves as the central hub for the Andromeda Initiative's colonization efforts. It is the first destination for all colonists upon their arrival in the new galaxy. Please enjoy the many venues the Nexus has to offer. As  the station expands, it will one day serve as the seat of government for Milky Way colonists. Providing a safe, stable and prosperous environment is our primary goal.

 

CORA:

Not from the looks of it.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Immigration

-Andromeda Galaxy

-The Nexus

-Living arrangements

-Current year

 

 

RYDER:

Where do colonists live?

 

AVINA:

Once you've cleared immigration, our helpful staff will assist you in choosing the homeworld of your dreams. Will it be the tropical paradise of Habitat 7? The gentle rolling hills of Habitat 3? Or perhaps the mysterious twilight world of Habitat 5? Whichever you choose, rest assured our Pathfinders have carefully vetted all colony worlds to ensure your security and prosperity.

 

RYDER:

Oh, boy.

 

LIAM:

Habitat 7? That's where we landed. She's way out of date.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Immigration

-Andromeda Galaxy

-The Nexus

-Living arrangements

-Current year

 

RYDER:

What year is it?

 

AVINA:

The current year is 2819. After spending 600 years in stasis, it's normal to feel disoriented or confused upon arrival. Our helpful medical staff can assist with any physical or psychological aftereffects you may be experiencing.

 

CORA:

Well, she's got the date right, at least.

 

RYDER:

So where is everyone?

 

[Ryder logs off.]

 

RYDER:

That's all.

 

AVINA:

It has been my pleasure. Please see one of our helpful immigration staff for further assistance. And welcome to our new home in Andromeda, where the brightest star is you! Current wait time for immigration processing is: UNKNOWN ERROR.

 

 

CORA:

Right. That was helpful.

 

[Ryder, Cora and Liam stare at the area.]

 

CORA:

It's like they didn't finish building it.

 

LIAM:

Hello?

 

RYDER:

This place should be packed with people.

 

[They walk down to reach the sub-platform. That’s when they see a Nexus construction worker.]

 

LIAM:

There's a guy. Maybe he's got champagne.

 

CORA:

Let's talk to that worker.

 

[They walk over to him.]

 

RYDER:

Hi, there.

 

[The construction worker gets up and turns around.]

 

RYDER:

We're from Ark Hyperion. And wondering where everybody went...?

 

[The construction worker looks shocked. He opens his mouth but no sounds come out. Ryder and Liam look at each other.]

 

LIAM:

Did he hear you?

 

WORKER:

Did you say an "ark"?

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

CASUAL -Is that a problem?

PROFESSIONAL -I did.

 

RYDER:

Yeah, we just got in.

 

CORA:

And for what it's worth, your VI over there could use an update.

 

WORKER:

But... we thought you were all dead!

 

[Cora looks shocked.]

 

CORA:

What?

 

WORKER:

Or captured. Or lost in dark space, or... But you're here. You have no idea how much this means.

 

KANDROS:

I don't believe it...

 

[Kandros, a turian, walks toward them.]

 

KANDROS:

I'm Tiran Kandros. I lead our militia on the Nexus.

 

[Ryder and Kandros shake hands.]

 

RYDER:

I'm Scott Ryder. This is Cora Harper and Liam Kosta, part of the Pathfinder team.

 

KANDROS:

I'm sorry for the confusion. Our sensors told us an ark had arrived, but Heleus is notorious for scrambling equipment. We thought you were just another malfuction.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -We're definitely here.

LOGICAL -Why is that?

 

RYDER:

But aren't you expecting us?

 

KANDROS:

You're the first ark we've seen. After a year of waiting and no sign of the others, we shuttered this area and stopped looking.

 

LIAM:

You've been stranded for a whole year?

 

 

KANDROS:

Longer. I'll fill you in on the way to Ops Center.

 

SCENE III
Going to Nexus Operations
 

[Kandros walks toward the tram. The Pathfinder team follows him.]

 

KANDROS:

Everything that could go wrong with our plan, has. We arrived fourteen months ago. Right away we hit a band of dark energy that knocked us off course.

 

RYDER:

We're familiar with it.

 

KANDROS:

Then you'll know why we call it the "Scourge." We lost whole sections of the station. A lot of people died. No power, no food... the chaos went on for months. It finally led to armed rebellion. When order was restored, the insurgents were banished. "Exiles," we call them.

 

CORA:

Are things back to normal?

 

KANDROS:

Not even close. But you're here now, so maybe the worst is over.  Ryder, we should get to the tram. A lot of people will want to see you.

 

[Ryder, Liam, Cora, and Kandros use the tram to reach Nexus Operations.]

 

CORA:

No word from other Pathfinders?

 

KANDROS:

No word from anyone, period.

 

LIAM:

Any threats from the locals?

 

KANDROS:

So far, we've stayed hidden. We're in no shape to deal with an attack.

 

RYDER:

We had a first contact situation on Habitat 7. Whole thing went south. They tried to kill us.

 

 

KANDROS:

That wasn't first contact—we know about them. Those aliens are going to be  a real problem.

 

CORA:

This day just keeps getting better.

 

KANDROS:

We're here.

 

ACT II
 

SCENE I
Meeting the Nexus Leadership
 

[Ryder, Liam, Cora, and Kandros exit the tram. Liam walks ahead.]

 

LIAM:

You guys go ahead. I'll check out the security situation.

 

[Kandros leads Cora and Ryder to the left. They walk up a ramp the next floor.]

 

KANDROS:

You should know our command structure has been fractured. Some of us are filling in for leaders who died.

 

[Two crew members rush past them.]

 

CREW 1:

Is it true?

 

CREW 2:

They said drop everything and report for duty.

 

[They keep walking.]

 

KANDROS:

... and no one was expecting an ark to finally show up.

 

[On the bridge, which can be reached by walking up some stairs, several crew members are standing in front of consoles.]

 

 

CREW:

Docking procedures are green across the board.

 

CREW 2:

Stand by to merge Hyperion power into the grid.

 

[As Kandros leads Cora and Ryder to the bridge, everyone stops working and stares. Three figures are seen closer than the others: a female human, a male salarian, and a female krogan. The male salarian walks toward them, watched by the human and the krogan.]

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

The crew of the Hyperion...

 

KANDROS:

Good luck.

 

[Kandros pats Ryder on the shoulder and leaves. Director Tann is now facing Ryder and Cora.]

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

I'm Jarun Tann, Director of the Initiative. You have no idea how much your arrival means to us.

 

[As he talks, the human woman who had been standing with Tann joins him.]

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -It means more to us.

LOGICAL -We’re here to assist. 

 

RYDER:

We've heard about what happened, and we're ready to help.

 

ADDISON:

We could use any supplies you have—food, water—we're short on everything.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

This is Foster Addison. She oversees Colonial Affairs.

 

[Tann looks at them, a bit surprised.]

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

Where's the Pathfinder?

 

RYDER:

You're looking at him.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

You're not Alec Ryder.

 

RYDER:

My father's dead. He made me his successor.

 

[Ryder looks sad. Addison looks sad as well.]

 

ADDISON:

Alec... is dead?

 

[Ryder lowers his eyes.]

 

ADDISON:

Please understand: the entire Initiative is at risk.

 

[She directs the entire group to look at a screen full of data.]

 

ADDISON:

None of the golden worlds have panned out. They're a bust. And there's been no word from the other arks.

 

CORA:

What happened to them?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

Unknown. Our supplies are nearly depleted. Rationing bought us some time, but even that's running out.

 

ADDISON:

We need to find more resources. But that takes people, and we can't wake them up—

 

RYDER:

—until they have somewhere to live. A golden world.

 

ADDISON:

Now more than ever, we need a Pathfinder.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

It now falls to you, Ryder. Are you up to the task?

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -I am.

LOGICAL -My father thought so.

CASUAL -Let’s hope so.

PROFESSIONAL -You don’t have a choice.

 

RYDER:

My father believed I am. If you trusted him with the job, you'll have to trust his judgment.

 

ADDISON:

Your father won't be around to fix things if you fail.

 

KESH:

That's no way to treat a guest.

 

[The female krogan from before joins the group.]

 

RYDER:

My father believed I am. If you trusted him with the job, you'll have to trust his judgment.

 

ADDISON:

Your father won't be around to fix things if you fail.

 

KESH:

I'm Nakmor Kesh, superintendent of this station. I hope they haven't scared you off already.

 

ADDISON:

It's nothing personal. But now isn't the time for on-the-job training.

 

KESH:

At least the Pathfinder here seems willing to try. We could use a fresh perspective.

 

[Addison and Kesh face each other.]

 

ADDISON:

You've heard my concerns. I'll leave you to it.

 

[Addison brushes past Kesh who looks at her leaving.]

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

We're all feeling the pressure. Let's have a private word in my office, Ryder. We'll discuss giving you a scout ship. I'm happy to work out the details with your associate?

 

[Tann points to Cora and leaves. Cora gives Ryder a pointed look before joining Tann. Kesh and Ryder are now alone.]

 

KESH:

Welcome to the Nexus.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -Thanks for helping.

LOGICAL -It’s a mess.

 

RYDER:

Thank you for standing up for me there.

 

 

KESH:

Hope's in short supply here. What little we can find should have a chance to bloom.

 

[A crew member interrupts them.]

 

CREW:

Ma'am, the Hyperion's core is now online.

 

[Kesh looks at Ryder.]

 

KESH:

Let me show you something.

 

[Kesh leads Ryder to the bridge’s central console.]

 

KESH:

An hour ago, that was all dark. But with the power from your ship—you're keeping the lights on. You have my vote.

 

[As she talks, lights appear on the bridge through the large windows which are no longer covered. It illuminates Ryder’s face, who watches, pensive. After a second, he turns to Kesh.]

 

RYDER:

And when the power runs out?

 

KESH:

You'd best go talk to Director Tann. Make sure that doesn't happen.

 

[She leaves, still talking to Ryder.]

 

KESH:

And don't be shy—come see me when you have a chance.

 

[The windows of the bridge are fully uncovered. Through them, Ryder can see the rest of the Nexus, still under construction. He’s at the center of the bridge, facing away.]

 

-> Additional scenes I

 

[Ryder walks toward a console on his left. A woman, the operations manager, is standing in front of it and talking to someone on her comm.]

 

OPERATIONS MANAGER:

Taila, where's Vetra at? The Hyperion is starting to send a tally of supplies. Handling something big, is she? I'll just organize this as it comes in and send it your way. You know what the priority needs are, anyway. Thank you.

 

[A salarian technician is using his omni-tool next to her and looking at the console.]

 

TECHNICIAN:

Hello, console. You and I are going to be very good friends. We'll get you all fixed up and ready to go in no time. As soon as we hook you up to all that juicy, juicy power.

 

OPERATIONS MANAGER;

Hmm, power couplers, more power relays, excellent. What... Girl Scout cookies. Hyperion's inventory lists Galactic Scout Cookies.

 

TECHNICIAN:

Wait, really? Seriously? I want those.

 

OPERATIONS MANAGER;

You'll have to fight Kesh for the Galaxy Swirls.

 

TECHNICIAN:

I don't care. It'll be worth it.

 

[A platform on the Nexus bridge is where Addison’s open office can be found. Addison is talking to someone on the comm. There is another man there, also talking on comm.]

 

NEXUS CONTROL:

This is Nexus Control to Hyperion. It's good to have you here.

 

LANI (COMM):

It's good to be here.

 

NEXUS CONTROL:

Excellent. Let's go over the docking checklist, shall we?

 

[Ryder gets closer to Addison and can hear her conversation.]

 

ADDISON (ON COMM):

No, it isn't what we wanted, but what choice do we have?—How the hell should I know? Spender, you have a job. If you want to keep it, do it. Goddamn it.

 

[Ryder hears an announcement on the Bridge: “Please be advised that Hyperion docking procedures are now complete.” He walks toward Addison. She crosses her arms when she sees him.]

 

ADDISON:

All right. What happened?

 

RYDER:

To who?

 

 

ADDISON:

"To whom," and your goddamn father.

 

[Ryder stares at her, disapproving. Addison puts a hand on her face.]

 

ADDISON:

Sorry, my face is tired from dealing with... everything. And right now, I just want to know what happened with Alec.

 

[She crosses her arms again.]

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -He wanted me to be Pathfinder.

LOGICAL -All that matters is he’s gone.

 

RYDER:

In the moment, it saved my life. But it seems my father meant for me to get the role eventually.

 

ADDISON:

It isn't hereditary. If we wanted an inbred monarchy, we could've left half our gene stock back home.

 

[Addison sighs.]

 

ADDISON:

Not "home." The Milky Way? This is home. This... mess. We don't have a lot of options, Ryder. Maybe you'll prove your father right. After fourteen months of failed colonization, forgive me if I don't hold my breath.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Colonial Director position

-Relationship with my father

-The plan for the hostiles

-Insight into strange tech

-Failing outposts

 

RYDER:

How do you fit into the Nexus leadership?

 

ADDISON:

I oversee the actual settlement effort. As the number of outposts is currently less than ideal, my influence is limited. As Tann is quick to remind me. Left a perfectly adequate career as a chief officer. Provincial capital, too. Only a new galaxy could pull me away. And here we are. Idling.

 

 

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Colonial Director position

-Relationship with my father

-The plan for the hostiles

-Insight into strange tech

-Failing outposts

 

RYDER:

You called my father Alec. No one does that.

 

ADDISON:

A lot of us joined the Initiative because of his vision. What he shared of it, anyway.

 

RYDER:

Were you friends, or...?

 

ADDISON:

I'm not your new mother, if that's what you're asking. Or his friend. He hated that I didn't use his title. But no one's a Pathfinder until they've pathfound something. Much like a Colonial Director without colonies.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Colonial Director position

-Relationship with my father

-The plan for the hostiles

-Insight into strange tech

-Failing outposts

 

RYDER:

There must be some kind of plan for encountering hostile aliens. We can't have been that naive.

 

ADDISON:

We expected life, not an enemy that refuses to talk. They don't attack—they disinfect. We're nothing until we're bacteria. Sorry. Fourteen months and you stoop to poetry. That's how bad it is. Not sure who started it, but we're calling them "kett." Kandros will know more. Maybe too much.

 

RYDER:

You don't trust him?

 

ADDISON:

I trust him to defend us. I do not trust a rising military influence in a supposedly civilian Initiative. We came here to make history, Ryder. Not repeat it. Ugh. Goddamn poetry.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Colonial Director position

-Relationship with my father

-The plan for the hostiles

-Insight into strange tech

-Failing outposts

 

RYDER:

There's also the strange technology? Has anyone studied that?

 

ADDISON:

We've tried. Not me—the brains in research. They're supposed to know their business. The current excuse? The tech we dug up on Mars was more advanced, but it was plug-and-go. The tech here... thinks different? I don't know. We've mostly avoided it. And from what the Hyperion logs say about Alec, maybe that's good.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Colonial Director position

-Relationship with my father

-The plan for the hostiles

-Insight into strange tech

-Failing outposts

 

RYDER:

You've had no colony successes in over a year? How many tries is that?

 

ADDISON:

Less than you'd think. The Scourge, spoiled worlds, exiles, hostiles... We can't just plop down an outpost and expect picket fences. We need the Pathfinder and SAM to scout, evaluate... and inspire. The Initiative promised a goal. Andromeda has not cooperated.

 

RYDER:

And if it had?

 

ADDISON:

Beautiful utopian horse shit. Colonies that produce and support each other. The Nexus as Citadel—not headed by Tann. Or even me.

 

RYDER:

Excuse me, Director Addison.

 

ADDISON:

Ryder...

 

RYDER:

It's "Pathfinder."

 

[Addison moves closer to Ryder until their faces are mere centimeters apart.]

 

 

 

ADDISON:

Ryder, we're starving here. If we don't get a foundation of outposts to feed the Initiative, we might as well be 600-years dead. Alec promised a lot. None of it panned out. That's what you're up against. Why people won't trust you. Why I don't trust you. Prove me wrong.

 

[Ryder walks down the stairs. On the far right of Nexus Operations is Kesh’s office. Ryder enters it. She’s on the comm with various people.]

 

KESH (COMM):

Yes, I know the Hyperion docking unannounced caused some switches to blow. That's fine.

(...)

I don't care. We know the problem is more widespread than we thought. We're working to fix it. That's all.

(...)

My crew's working on it. We've moved the ops center to the top of our priority list.

(...)

That's an entire sector showing green. Good job, you two.

(...)

I'll check it out myself as soon as I have a moment. Move on to the docks for now.

 

[Kesh notices Ryder.]

 

KESH:

There you are. Hope the others haven't been giving you a hard time. There's a lot that needs doing. At least with the Hyperion hooked up and feeding us power, my team and I can get more work done.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Krogan whereabouts

-Nexus problems

-The genophage

-Your job

 

RYDER:

I noticed there aren't a lot of krogan around?

 

KESH:

You haven't spoken to Number Eight yet, have you?

 

RYDER:

Number Eight?

 

KESH:

Tann. Ask him why most of my people left. He'll have opinions. I can tell you this much. When the mutiny happened, a deal was made. My clan was supposed to settle matters and, in return, get more say in the Initiative.

 

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Number Eight

-Krogan deal with Tann

 

RYDER:

Why do you call Tann "Eight"?

 

KESH:

Because he was eighth in line to take over the Andromeda Initiative. I like to remind him of that now and then. Keep him... humble.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Number Eight

-Krogan deal with Tann

 

RYDER:

Did the deal go through?

 

KESH:

The clan held up their part, but Tann had a meltdown when he found   out we wanted more say around here. Then Addison's assistant, Spender, pretended he never made the deal in the first place. It was a mess, but I don't blame my people for walking out. We're done being used.

 

RYDER:

With your clan gone... why did you stay?

 

KESH:

It's... complicated. The station and my clan both need me here.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Krogan whereabouts

-Nexus problems

-The genophage

-Your job

 

RYDER:

What sort of problems have you seen on the Nexus?

 

KESH:

"Situation's gone to shit" pretty much sums it up. There's arks missing. Some idiots tried to mutiny and take over, then more idiots offended my clan, so they left. And to top it all off, the founder of the Initiative, Jien Garson, was killed.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Jien Garson

-More about Nexus problems

 

RYDER:

What happened to Jien Garson?

 

KESH:

Killed in the Scourge disaster. Her and a bunch of the other leaders. Tann might know more.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Jien Garson

-More about Nexus problems

 

RYDER:

And I thought the Hyperion had it bad when we arrived. Anything else?

 

KESH:

The outposts aren't happening because we don't have resources or people, so Addison's more uptight than ever. And let's not forget how badly the station was damaged on arrival. But that's a detail, according to some. My team and I are repairing what we can. If we don't get materials soon, things will go downhill. Fast.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Krogan whereabouts

-Nexus problems

-The genophage

-Your job

 

RYDER:

When we left the Milky Way, the krogan were still dealing with the genophage.

 

KESH:

Right. The genophage. A little "gift" to our people from the salarians thousands of years ago. That sterility virus they infected us with left most of our children stillborn. Only one in a thousand survive.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Salarian involvement

-State of a cure

 

RYDER:

No wonder your people have such a problem with salarians.

 

KESH:

Some wounds never heal. Not that my ancestors didn't provoke it. They did try to conquer the galaxy. The salarians were forced to respond. And it's not fair to blame it all on them, either. The salarians developed the virus, but it was the turians who deployed it. I'm hoping that's all in the past. Plenty of blame to go around, but Andromeda is about new beginnings. My people need that more than most.

 

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Salarian involvement

-State of a cure

 

RYDER:

What about the krogan here in Andromeda?

 

KESH:

There's no cure for it. But my clan was starting to show a mutation against the virus. A natural defense. During the trip to get here, krogan underwent gene therapies to enhance the mutation while we were in stasis.

 

RYDER:

So you used those 600 years to your advantage. Gave the adaptation more time to develop.

 

KESH:

Yeah. It's still early, but I think we made a dent. Our scientists say we've improved viability to almost 4%, which is a lot better than what we had. Beyond all the statistics, it means more krogan children will live. It's the only way my people have a future out here.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

RYDER:

What kind of work do you do as superintendent?

 

KESH:

I was part of the team that originally designed and built this place. I keep the station functional, or as functional as possible, considering.

 

RYDER:

Nothing more for now.

 

KESH:

Try not to die out there.

 

[Ryder leaves Kesh’s office. Behind the platform where Addison’s office can be found is the Nexus information wall. Ryder stands in front of the wall to consult it. As he uses it, different images are displayed. Jien Garson’s picture is shown as she introduces the Welcome Vid.]

 

JIEN GARSON:

Hello. I'm Jien Garson, founder of the Initiative. It's through your hard work that the vision of the Nexus has come to life. You—and all your colleagues—bind our proud new colonies together. Look around at your achievements. And if you have any questions, my door is always open.

WELCOME VID:

Viable planets, capable of supporting life, are key to our survival in Andromeda. The viability of a world is affected by several factors, including temperature, resources, threat levels, political stability, and so on. We have few viable planets currently within range. Resources levels are considered at-risk. 

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

WELCOME VID:

The selection process saw the Andromeda Initiative evaluate thousands of potential habitable planets within the galaxy. After discovering an unusually high ratio of potential candidates, or "golden worlds," the Heleus Cluster was selected as our destination. Even at a distance, studying the light from stars can reveal much about their planets' composition and atmosphere. Seven worlds, nicknamed "habitats," have the life-supporting environments and resources we need to start our new lives in Andromeda.

 

[A technician is standing near the information wall.]

 

TECHNICIAN (COMM):

Melo, you already checked the consoles down here, right? (...) Huh. I think you forgot to hit confirm when you filled out the forms. They're not listed. (...) Nah, it's fine. If you say you fixed them, you did. I'll just check those boxes for you.

(...)

Right then, Lia. Try firing off sets 23-B to 54-C in the third quadrant. (...) Did that work? Excellent. I'll move on to the next set. We'll get this place fixed eventually.

 

[Ryder walks down the ramp. To his right is the militia office, where Kandros is seen standing in front of an oval console where Strike Team missions can be managed. Ryder goes to talk to him.]

 

KANDROS:

I know that look. The others bent your ear, did they?

 

RYDER:

Something like that.

 

KANDROS:

You get used to it. Just focus on being a Pathfinder. Can't argue with results, though they'll try. Anyway, welcome to militia HQ. Excuse the mess. This office fields militia work, Nexus security, and looking for the turian ark.

 

RYDER:

What's the word on the turian ark?

 

KANDROS:

Scattered readings. Some indicate the Natanus was destroyed, others that people are alive—who knows? If you need anything, come see me. Even if it's just to vent.

I was tired of being the good one.

 

[Kandros uses air quotes when saying “good one.”]

 

RYDER:

"The good one"?

 

KANDROS:

The Kandros family is old military. There were expectations. You know. Then my sister became a sculptor and Cousin Nyreen went pirate on Omega. Everyone was proud that I stayed in service. But I kept wondering "When do I get my adventure?" Jien Garson's dream was so... grand, so gutsy. I had to be part of it.

KANDROS:

I was escorting a prospecting team on some moon, when those kett found us. They penned us like cattle for experiments. I managed to get loose, snatched a gun, and freed the others. By the time we killed the bastards and headed back to warn the Nexus, everyone looked at me like I was in charge.

 

RYDER:

That sounds familiar.

The militia grew from there. Funny: once the heat is on, all kinds of people rise to the top.

KANDROS:

So so. We're not good at sitting around in a crisis. "Service before self" gets drummed into us at boot camp. That's probably why so many of us are in the militia. We like to earn our citizenship, whatever galaxy we're in. But it's hard to focus with our ark missing.

We usually see them on worlds with those alien structures. The kett don't take kindly to anyone studying them. Not sure why. They don't talk to us. Every time we cross paths, there's a fight or they take prisoners.

 

RYDER:

Why? What do they want?

 

KANDROS:

No one knows. But I've seen their weaponry, and what they do to those prisoners. I want them a long, long way from the Nexus.

I have strike teams specializing in assault and extraction. If you need serious firepower, my APEX teams have you covered. In fact... I could give you authority to dispatch them. It'll cut down their response time. Our current ops are on the terminal. See if there's anything that could use a shot where it counts.

 

RYDER:

Bye, Kandros. Duty calls.

 

KANDROS:

You and me both, Pathfinder.

 

[There is a female turian near Kandros. She’s speaking out loud.]

 

MARIETTE:

What am I going to do?

 

[Ryder approaches her.]

 

MARIETTE:

It's not right. It's not fair.

 

RYDER:

What's wrong?

 

MARIETTE:

Oh my, you're... so it's true, a Pathfinder has found us. There's hope at last. Maybe you could help—you're impartial. This whole thing has  gotten so political. My husband… he's locked up and slated for exile—for a crime he didn't commit.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

CASUAL -Must have been bad.

PROFESSIONAL -What was the crime?

 

RYDER:

What exactly was he convicted of?

 

 

MARIETTE:

They don't exile you for petty theft. Well, maybe this bunch would. They say it's murder. They're calling him the first murderer in Andromeda. But the dead man was his friend—he wouldn't have... There are witnesses and evidence, but it's all circumstantial. At worst, it was an accident. His name is Nilken Rensus. He could give you the details, if you were willing to speak with him—please?

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

-Of course.

-There might not be time.

 

RYDER:

I'd be happy to.

 

MARIETTE:

Oh, thank you. I'm sure the jailer will allow you a visit. Please—tell Nilken I love him.

 

[Ryder moves to the far left of the militia office. Liam is there, standing next to tables with multiple terminals and screens above them. A woman is standing next to Liam.]

 

LIAM:

Pathfinder. No time for our beer yet. This place is a mess. Security is... let's call it strained.

 

RYDER:

I can believe it. The Nexus is running on empty.

LOGICAL -They may all be dead.

 

RYDER:

They were frustrated. If they just wanted to kill, they could have fought to the last here.

 

LIAM:

Apparently we're the big hope for everyone. Not the Hyperion showing. Just... us. I'm with you. It's just... a lot.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

CASUAL -I’m kind of freaked out.

PROFESSIONAL -We’ll get it back to spec.

 

RYDER:

This wasn't in the job description. We have to find a world, then save it.

 

 

LIAM:

Glad it's not just me feeling it. But it's not just you, either. We're a team, right? It's what they need us to be.

 

[Ryder keeps walking and finds himself on the Operations deck. Multiple terminals cover the walls, and crew members are working in front of them. A group of three people are talking amongst themselves near one of the terminals. Ryder gets closer.]

 

PROFESSOR HERIK:

But the planet was toxic. What if they store oxygen in porous tissue, like Quero's rockfish?

 

CHIEF LUCAN:

I still reckon they had breather gear stowed in that armor.

 

DOCTOR ARIDANA:

Perhaps both. Life is infinitely adaptable, as our expedition proves

 

[Professor Herik notices Ryder.]

 

PROFESSOR HERIK:

You must be the Pathfinder. Wonderful! You and your SAM are exactly what we need.

 

RYDER:

Thanks, mister...?

 

PROFESSOR HERIK:

Professor Herik. My colleague and I will work with your SAM and the data you gather to solve Andromeda's scientific mysteries.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -Can I join in?

LOGICAL -What are your specialties?

 

RYDER:

What fields do you study?

 

CHIEF LUCAN:

Herik's into life science. I do planetary geology, oceanography—rocks and runoff. Aridana's the space and math whiz.

 

PROFESSOR HERIK:

Not that we've had much to study, with everyone cooped up for fourteen months...

 

DOCTOR ARIDANA:

But your data on the Scourge flows like poetry. Now we can better advise on repairing the damage it caused.

 

 

PROFESSOR HERIK:

And maybe Addison will give us a real workspace. Who can think with all this racket?

 

[Ryder can talk with each specialist individually. He starts with Doctor Aridana.]

 

DOCTOR ARIDANA:

Pathfinder, we've had some trouble.

 

RYDER:

Anything I can help with?

 

DOCTOR ARIDANA:

Perhaps. I discharged an away team to get readings from a section of the Scourge that was behaving anomalously. They haven't reported in for some time, and sensors can't locate their shuttle. I sent them out there. Good, dedicated people. I fear what might have happened to them.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -Have hope.

LOGICAL -Stay focused.

 

RYDER:

Don’t give up hope. When I’m out there, I’ll see if I can find them.

 

DOCTOR ARIDANA:

Their friends and family will want to know what's happened. And I... I need to know.

 

[Ryder speaks to Chief Lucan next.]

 

CHIEF LUCAN:

Hi, Pathfinder. Want to hit some rocks for science?

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

-Try and stop me.

-Maybe later.

 

CHIEF LUCAN:

Hi, Pathfinder. Want to hit some rocks for science?

 

RYDER:

Absolutely. What do you need?

 

CHIEF LUCAN:

SAM and I used your scans and made a VI for geophysics surveys. Beta build's on the console there. Test it out in the field, and I'll wrangle you a "consultant's bonus" from Director Addison. How's that sound?

 

[Ryder talks to Professor Herik.]

 

PROFESSOR HERIK:

Pathfinder! Those bio scans are superb. Could you gather more for our Comparative Conservation Effort? 

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

-That sounds interesting.

-Sorry, I’m busy.

 

RYDER:

What conservation effort?

 

PROFESSOR HERIK:

Ah, my thesis is on the console there. Broad strokes: we're comparing and preserving organisms from both galaxies. If you donate more bio scans and samples to the catalogue, I can get you a finder's fee. Tempted?

 

[Ryder goes to the console.]

 

PROFESSOR HERIK:

We can start building a bank of vaccines, once we get more biomaterial.

 

CHIEF LUCAN:

It's that Scourge I'm wondering about. Standard colony radiation shields should handle it. But I hate "should."

 

[He activates the mission given to him by the team of scientists.]

 

PROFESSOR HERIK:

And its gas bladder can expand three hundred per cent! Amazing!

 

CHIEF LUCAN:

Hey, Herik. How about you not dissect things over lunch? It's weird.

 

[Ryder speaks with Doctor Aridana again.]

 

DOCTOR ARIDANA:

The beauty of the cosmos unfolds in your planet scans, Pathfinder. But there is more they can do.

 

RYDER:

Do you have something in mind, Doctor?

 

DOCTOR ARIDANA:

Plans for a school are under way, to inspire a new generation of young minds. I want to craft a model of the cluster for them, accurate and splendid, from your data. My prototype is on that console. Add more scans to improve it, and I will share my educational budget with you. And my thanks.

 

[Ryder activates the mission on the console. He then leaves the Operations desk. In the next room, crates are still being unpacked, but three terminals with screens are operational. Ryder can consult the terminal at the center, which shows emails from Director Tann to Tiran Kandros called “Damage Controls” and “Report: Exiles”. Ryder finds his way to the next room near the ramp. In front of him is an arms merchant. To Ryder’s left is a turian standing guard in front of huge glass cell doors. Another turian is locked in one of those cells. Ryder first talks to the arms merchant.]

 

MERCHANT:

Weapons and stuff I got you covered. Use the console to take a look through what I've got. It'd be a lot easier if I weren't missing half my stock...

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

CASUAL -Sure thing.

PROFESSIONAL -What’s with these prices?

 

RYDER:

Ouch. Why am I paying for these?

 

MERCHANT:

Half the supplies are inaccessible, what with how we crash-landed and all. And I have to trade with the crooks out there for the rest, so...

 

[After looking at what the merchant has to offer, Ryder finds the turian by the cells, Sergeant Aker.]

 

SERGEANT AKER:

Help you?

 

RYDER:

Pathfinder Ryder. Here to see Nilken Rensus.

 

SERGEANT AKER:

Ah, our murderer. Wife's here all the time. Guess she told you her sob story.

 

[Sergeant Aker looks at the turian in the cell.]

 

SERGEANT AKER:

Nilken, you're moving up in the world. There's a Pathfinder wanting to chat with you.

 

[In the cell, Nilken Rensus steps forward so he can face Ryder.]

 

RENSUS:

A Pathfinder, huh? They called in the big guns to exile Andromeda's First Murderer.

 

 

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -Wife says you’re innocent.

LOGICAL -Not why I’m here.

 

RYDER:

Your wife's all broken up over this. She says you didn't do it. And that she loves you.

 

RENSUS:

(Sighs.) She's a wonderful person. At this point, it's too late. They found me guilty.

 

RYDER:

Why don't you tell me what happened?

 

RENSUS:

I was part of the futile effort to set up a colony on Eos. We were on our last legs, overrun by hostiles, our leader dead. The security chief, Reynolds—my friend—he refused to call for evacuation. I argued with him. Everyone saw.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -Arguments happen.

LOGICAL -And then he ended up dead?

 

RYDER:

So when he was killed, people assumed you did it?

 

RENSUS:

For good reason. He ordered us to regroup and counter attack. We were moving through a sandstorm. I saw movement, thought it was the kett, and I—I guess I panicked and fired... A witness saw the Chief's chest explode.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -That’s terrible.

LOGICAL -So it was unintentional.

 

RYDER:

Sounds like an accident.

 

 

RENSUS:

That's what I told them. But I was enraged when we argued. There's a recording. It's ugly. Everyone's certain I did it on purpose so we could evacuate. Only my word otherwise.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -Don’t give up.

LOGICAL -The evidence will decide.

 

RYDER:

I'll check out the evidence. Maybe something doesn't add up.

 

RENSUS:

It would be nice to have someone with an open mind looking at it. You're a Pathfinder—I'm sure Kandros would give you access. Maybe there's still hope.

 

[Ryder leaves. The technician is still upstairs on the comm—Ryder can hear him.]

 

TECHNICIAN:

Lia, remember when I said I was going to take a look inside the panel here? I should perhaps have listened when you suggested not pursuing this course of action. No, I'm fine. Just a bump on my head. And don't you dare laugh.

(...)

No, I'm fine. No, nothing happened. Honestly, Yolanda. I'm fine. I'm going back to work now.

 

[Tann’s office is located on the far left of Colonials Affairs. Ryder walks up the ramp and hears the Operations Manager.]

 

OPERATIONS MANAGER:

Yeah, looks like the Blast-Ohs got displaced at the last minute. Hopefully one of the other arks will have some in stock. I'll keep an eye out.

 

[Ryder finds Kandros again.]

 

KANDROS:

No news on the turian ark yet. Or is this militia business?

 

RYDER:

I spoke with Nilken Rensus. The man found guilty of the murder on Eos.

 

KANDROS:

Yes, our first murder here in Andromeda. I wish it had been our last. When the colony attempts failed, it didn't help spirits that a high-ranking officer was killed by one of our own. The mutiny here on Nexus was probably inevitable but this acted as a spark.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -Isn’t that a reach?

LOGICAL -And he was found guilty.

 

RYDER:

It doesn't seem right to put all that on him.

 

KANDROS:

of course it isn't. But that's the perception. Despite the lack of physical evidence, everything added up. His only defense was: "Trust me. I didn't mean to do it."

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -And you didn’t trust him?

LOGICAL -That matters.

RYDER:

And you assume he's lying.

 

KANDROS:

What's a lie to a murderer? Look, knock yourself out. A key witness, Cassidy Shaw, works in Operations. Go ahead and talk to her. And there's a recording of the perpetrator threatening the victim. I'll let you cue it up on the console there. As far as I'm concerned, this case is closed.

 

[Ryder goes to the console and listens to the recording.]

 

KANDROS (AUDIO LOG):

The Nexus vs Colonist Nilken. Evidence 7-A.

 

RENSUS (AUDIO LOG):

Hiram? Hiram! They've seized the compound! Call for evacuation!

 

CHIEF REYNOLDS (AUDIO LOG):

We're not giving up, Nilken! We're taking it back!

 

RENSUS (AUDIO LOG):

No! I'm not letting your ego get us killed, even if I have to...! (Angry grunting.)

 

CHIEF REYNOLDS (AUDIO LOG):

(Grunting.) No! Get him off me—get him off me!

 

[The recording ends. A few feet from the console, Liam is still talking to the woman from the Security team.]

 

LIAM:

Noticed a hand-off there. Too small for illicits.

 

SECURITY:

You'd be surprised. There's ossilbir vine in the seed bank.

 

LIAM:

Nobody's making creeper in Andromeda.

 

SECURITY:

You'd be surprised.

 

[Ryder goes to speak with him.]

 

LIAM:

Pathfinder, I'm feeling less bad about missing a year of this. Everyone's beaten down. Nothing to do but watch the reserves shrink.

 

 

RYDER:

And now all eyes are on us.

 

LIAM:

All I know is: we have to fix it.

 

(...)

 

LIAM:

Quieter here. Still get opinions, of course. And talk to security. 

 

RYDER:

What about?

 

LIAM:

Leaders. Direction. Lack of it. Tann is the standout but none of them have made friends.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -It pisses me off.

LOGICAL -Who would you support?

 

RYDER:

Who would you say is actually measuring up?

 

LIAM:

My dad would say elections were rubbish, because you don't get people who could do the job, you got politicians. By that measure, I'd go Addison. She does not want that job.

 

[Ryder goes to the Colonial Affairs’s deck. The final docking procedures are in progress.]

 

NEXUS CONTROL:

All right, moving on. Docking clamps?

 

LANI:

Fully active and engaged.

 

NEXUS CONTROL:

Docking hatch integrity?

LANI:

100%, Nexus Control.

 

NEXUS CONTROL:

And we're done. Hyperion status: all clear.

 

[Ryder approaches Cassidy Shaw.]

 

RYDER:

Cassidy Shaw? I'm Scott Ryder. I'm looking into the Nilken murder case.

CASSIDY SHAW:

Oh man, I thought that was over with. Have you heard of the audio recording of their flight?

 

RYDER:

Yes.

 

CASSIDY SHAW:

I helped pull him off Chief Reynolds. You could see it in his eyes: he was going to kill him. Then in the sandstorm... I had a pretty clear view of the Chief. He looked right at Nilken and shouted "No!" Then his chest burst open. I'll never forget it: the look on his face was pure... shock.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Were there kett there?

-Did Nilken regret it?

-Why was the Chief shocked?

-Did you agree with the Chief?

 

RYDER:

Did you see any kett in the vicinity?

 

CASSIDY SHAW:

Nilken said so, but not that I could see. Still, the sandstorm was severe. Visibility wasn't great.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Were there kett there?

-Did Nilken regret it?

-Why was the Chief shocked?

-Did you agree with the Chief?

 

RYDER:

Did Nilken seem remorseful?

 

CASSIDY SHAW:

I lost sight of Nilken in the turmoil. When we found him, he seemed in shock. He couldn't speak—he looked nauseated. Could have been guilt—the reality of the act sinking in.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Were there kett there?

-Did Nilken regret it?

-Why was the Chief shocked?

-Did you agree with the Chief? 

 

RYDER:

If they'd fought and Nilken threatened to kill him, why was Reynolds surprised?

 

 

CASSIDY SHAW:

Friends fight, say things they don't mean, maybe even hurt each other... But you don't expect your best friend to shoot you. To me, that's the saddest part. The Chief's heart was broken right before it exploded.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Were there kett there?

-Did Nilken regret it?

-Why was the Chief shocked?

-Did you agree with the Chief? 

 

RYDER:

Reynolds was leading you back to retake the compound. Did you agree with that?

 

CASSIDY SHAW:

It wasn't my place to agree or disagree. He was ranking officer. In retrospect, it is ironic. If he hadn't been killed, we all probably would have died.

 

RYDER:

I appreciate the information.

 

CASSIDY SHAW:

Of course. It kills me we had to leave him behind. He deserved a proper funeral.

 

RYDER:

So the body was never examined? Important piece of a murder investigation.

 

CASSIDY SHAW:

Tann wouldn't allow a mission to go back for him. Said it was too dangerous.

 

[Ryder is about to leave the deck when he hears Lani.]

 

LANI:

Nexus Control, I'm getting some odd automated requests from the station's systems. Some sort of redundant power relay checks. What's up with that?

 

NEXUS CONTROL:

Before we removed them from the station, the mutineers left some surprises in the system. The superintendent has had everyone on deck manually double-checking the relays. It'll be in the security update, somewhere in your message queue.

 

[He leaves the deck. The salarian technician and the Operations Manager are still near the same console on the main bridge, talking to one another.]

 

OPERATIONS MANAGER:

Melo?

 

 

MELO:

Yes?

 

OPERATIONS MANAGER:

You realize everyone can hear you, right?

 

MELO:

Yes.

 

OPERATIONS MANAGER:

(Chuckles.) And you just don't care.

 

MELO:

Yes!

 

[Ryder walks past them and finds his way to Tann’s Office.]

 

SCENE II
Talking to Tann
[Ryder heads to Tann’s office. Cora is there talking to Tann. Both are watching data from a console in front of them.]

 

CORA:

...This is the planet where we landed, Habitat 7. It wasn't even close to livable.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

That's been true of every world we've found.

 

[Tann notices Ryder, who stands in front of the console on the opposite side from Tann and Cora.]

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

Ryder—we were discussing your next expedition.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

CASUAL -About time.

PROFESSIONAL -You trust me now?

 

RYDER:

I thought I didn't measure up as Pathfinder.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

Director Addison keeps her own counsel, I keep mine.

 

RYDER:

And when you disagree?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

I oversee the entire Initiative, and I've decided to give you a chance to prove yourself. To that end, the Scourge dealt us a serious blow. Whatever it is, our scientists theorize it's not natural.

 

CORA:

An artificial energy cloud?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

It wasn't here when we left the Milky Way. Yet it rendered all the golden worlds unlivable. Then there's the aliens you ran into—"the kett." They're obsessed with alien structures we've found scattered around the cluster. They'll do anything to prevent others from accessing them. It seems murder isn't exclusive to the Milky Way.

 

[Tann touches the console.]

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

And now the challenge is to settle a world in spite of all that. This one here—"Eos."

 

[A projection of Eos appears above the console.]

 

RYDER:

How?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

You need to increase the viability of the planet so we can establish an outpost. Then we can bring more colonists out of stasis. The more colonists we have, the more resources we can gather to support the Nexus. Everything depends on it. There are six worlds we hope to settle.

 

RYDER:

Okay... but you said every planet you found is unlivable. So, how do I...

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

A good Pathfinder would relish the challenge of solving it.

 

CORA:

Right. I think I should... go check on things.

 

[Cora leaves Tann’s office.]

 

RYDER:

And if I fail, I guess it's no sweat off your back, right? You'll just look for another Pathfinder?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

Placing bets on people is part of my job. Some of them pay off. Others...

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

CASUAL -Don’t play games with me.

PROFESSIONAL -Just point the way.

 

RYDER:

Just point me to my ship, and I'll be out of here.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

They're prepping it now, in the docking bay. The coordinates for Eos will be in the computer. And when you have a moment, we should discuss the missing arks.

 

RYDER:

I was wondering about tha—

 

[Ryder hears a piercing noise, which makes him grunt in discomfort.]

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

Something wrong?

 

SAM (PRIVATE):

Ryder, please see me in SAM Node on the Hyperion. Your implant needs attention, and we need to discuss a confidential matter.

 

[Ryder listens to SAM without saying anything, then raises his hand in reply to Tann.]

 

RYDER:

No... I'm fine.

 

-> Additional scenes II

 

[Ryder can have a longer conversation with Director Tann in his office.]

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

Ryder. You have my condolences for your father.

 

RYDER:

I appreciate it.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

I didn't know him very well, although I understand he played a key role in planning the Initiative. I'm sure he'd be concerned that we still have several arks missing.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -I’ll find them.

LOGICAL -What happened to them?

 

RYDER:

Any idea where they went?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

Nothing certain. But tens of thousands of colonists are unaccounted for. It paints the Initiative in an unflattering light. Did you have some other business?

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Nexus troubles

-The Andromeda Initiative

-Tann's role

-Missing arks

-Planet viability

 

RYDER:

It sounds like the Nexus has had a rough time of it.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

Publicly, I would say we're more than up for the challenge. Privately, I can tell you it's been a disaster. The Scourge killed hundreds—many of them our senior leadership. Even the founder of the Initiative, Jien Garson, is dead.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Jien Garson's death

-Scourge disaster

-Mysteries on Habitat 7

 

RYDER:

How did Jien Garson die?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

With the rest of the leadership. When the Nexus hit the Scourge, a large wing of stasis pods was destroyed. They were killed instantly. These people traveled for 600 years and died before they even woke up. Jien Garson never glimpsed Heleus. She never saw her vision realized.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Jien Garson's death

-Scourge disaster

-Mysteries on Habitat 7

 

RYDER:

Kandros mentioned something about hitting the Scourge. How did it play out?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

Criminal elements took advantage of the emergency and preyed on people's fears. An uprising followed. We had no choice but to turn to the krogan to deal with them. They crushed the mutiny and the criminals were banished. "Exiles," we call them. I doubt we've heard the last of them. They're led by an outlaw. Sloane Kelly. She used to be one of ours.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Sloane Kelly

-Where are the krogan?

 

RYDER:

Who is this Sloane Kelly?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

She was head of security on the Nexus. She opposed the uprising at first, but eventually turned traitor and joined them. Misguided sympathy for the plight of the common citizen. Nonsense. They posed a direct threat to our existence.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Sloane Kelly

-Where are the krogan?

 

RYDER:

There don't seem to be many krogan around.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

Good riddance. The krogan demanded a greater say in political matters—the last place you want them involved. They're muscle, nothing more. Good for fighting and lifting heavy objects. When they didn't get what they wanted, they left.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Sloane Kelly

-Where are the krogan?

-Dislike for krogan

 

RYDER:

Why don't you like the krogan?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

It's common knowledge they're a violent, ignorant species. Long ago, they waged nuclear war on one another. Their planet was decimated. My people tried to uplift them, but the krogan could never tame their worst instincts. What if they bring their tempers to Andromeda? We'll all be dead.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Jien Garson's death

-Scourge disaster

-Mysteries on Habitat 7

 

 

 

RYDER:

We came across alien technology on Habitat 7. It seemed to affect the weather. Your people know anything about that?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

There have been reports. Failed scouting missions have mentioned advanced structures of unknown design. Whatever they are, they defy explanation. But with our resources stretched so tight, no one has had a chance to study them. And what if the answer was bad for morale? Suppose these things turn people into food? All we know is the kett are interested in them. I'd rather not stir things up.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Nexus troubles

-The Andromeda Initiative

-Tann's role

-Missing arks

-Planet viability

 

RYDER:

What more can you tell me about the Initiative?

DIRECTOR TANN:

It represents the greatest migration ever attempted. No one had ventured beyond the Milky Way before. We've all left home in search of freedom, fortune, perhaps a new beginning. We're the bravest souls each species has to offer. I hope the Nexus will serve as the seat of government for us all.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Initiative origins

-Motivations for coming

-Alien species on Nexus

 

RYDER:

What do you know about the early days of the Initiative?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

As most everyone knows, Jien Garson's vision made it happen. She was an entrepreneur on Earth. Wealthy. Young for a human. Garson had the idea for the Initiative in the early 2170s, I believe. Many thought leaving the Milky Way was impossible. But she persevered. And as with most great ideas, the doubters were wrong.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Initiative origins

-Motivations for coming

-Alien species on Nexus

 

RYDER:

Why do you think most people came?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

There are thousands of reasons, one for every colonist here. What does any pilgrim seek? Usually, happiness. Finding the thing that eludes them... the thing to fulfill them. While we can't promise they will find it, we can facilitate the search.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Initiative origins

-Motivations for coming

-Alien species on Nexus

 

RYDER:

It looks like a melting pot around here.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

The Nexus is home to several Initiative species. Many came ahead of the arks. The hope is that this station will one day serve as the governing body in Andromeda. Though I'm not sure what they were thinking, lumping krogan into the mix. As a salarian, my kind tend to have a low opinion of them. Nothing I’ve seen here has changed that.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

RYDER:

As Director of the Initiative, are you in charge around here or what?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

If the others would allow me. They don't see me as the right successor.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Gridlock?

-Why the doubt?

 

RYDER:

So how does anything get done?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

In theory, Kesh handles the Nexus' physical operations, Kandros runs the militia, and Addison manages Colonial Affairs. I oversee all of it. In practice, we argue, debate, and yell at each other until a decision is made... if we're lucky. it is maddening.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Gridlock?

-Why the doubt?

 

RYDER:

What's their problem with you?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

I'm not Jien Garson. Our founder was charismatic. Eccentric. Larger than life. Traits I can't hope to mimic. She and her inner circle perished in the Scourge. Some at the hands of the exiles. Some never made it out of stasis. I was Deputy Assistant for Revenue Management. Then all seven leaders above me died. I was next in line for the role.

 

RYDER:

So... you're an accountant?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

Don't let that fool you. We're all capable of more than we know. When I was young, I was fascinated by the idea of exploring space. Life had its detours and I went a different direction. Then I heard about the Initiative—and saw my chance to try the path not taken. While I may not be setting foot on new worlds, my authority can ensure that you do.

 

RYDER:

Right. Sorry.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Nexus troubles

-The Andromeda Initiative

-Tann's role

-Missing arks

-Planet viability

 

RYDER:

Any more information you can give me on the missing arks?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

No, and that's the distressing part. The asari, turian, and salarian arks are completely unaccounted for. If they had the same problems with the Scourge that we did, I fear the worst. Should you find any clues, please investigate. Without the other arks, the promise of the Initiative can never be fulfilled.

 

RYDER:

Are there any other arks we should expect?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

We'd hoped quarians would be part of the first wave. But before departure in 2185, we got word they had technical problems with their ship. It seems they're also bringing along drell, hanar, and other species as well. Managing all their biological needs caused complications. We won't see them for some time to come.

 

 

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Nexus troubles

-The Andromeda Initiative

-Tann's role

-Missing arks

-Planet viability

 

RYDER:

What do I need to consider in making a planet viable?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

Assuming the planet supports life, an outpost is critical. People like a roof over their heads. And you'll want to eliminate any hostile threats. Whether that's the kett, or other terrors lurking in Heleus, colonists being murdered on sight can be discouraging. Also, scouting and mapping terrain is a priority for any Pathfinder. And don't forget forward stations. You'll want those.

 

RYDER:

What can you tell me about forward stations?

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

I was afraid you'd ask. It's mostly what the engineers tell me. "A forward station allows mining, equipment repairs, and re-supply for field teams." I mean, who wouldn't want that? But seeing as how every colonization effort has failed, it's just theory at the moment. You get to test it out, Ryder.

 

[Ryder can now ask him about the Nilken Rensus case.]

 

RYDER:

I'm looking into the Nilken Rensus murder charge.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

And?

 

RYDER:

I want to go to Eos and retrieve Chief Reynold's body.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

That isn't usually Pathfinder business.

 

RYDER:

First murder in Andromeda. And I'm impartial—figured you'd want to get it right.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

Settling an outpost comes first, but I suppose I have no objections. Physical evidence will only bolster the case.

 

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -I’m not sure he did it.

LOGICAL -The body can reveal much.

 

RYDER:

The more certain we can be, the better.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

All right, but let's keep it quiet. I don't want people thinking we're opening the case. I hope anything you find reaffirms what's been done. But if it sheds a different light, we'll deal with it. We'll send the coordinates of the murder scene. Good luck.

 

RYDER:

That's all. Thanks for your time.

 

DIRECTOR TANN:

I'm happy to help. You'll find our futures depend on each other's success. Good luck.

 

[Ryder leaves Tann’s office. In the Operations Center, directly in front of him and below the Colonial Affairs deck, a technician named Raj Patil is working on a panel.]

 

RAJ PATIL:

Yeah, looks fine so far...

 

[The panel short-circuits and smoke comes out of it. Raj Patil cries out in surprise and pain. Ryder walks toward him.]

 

RYDER:

Hey—you okay?

 

RAJ PATIL:

I'm fine. My arms got the brunt of it.

 

RYDER:

Stuff exploding like this happen often?

 

RAJ PATIL:

Back right after the mutiny, we had a lot of this happening, but not lately.

 

RYDER:

I wasn't there during the mutiny.

 

RAJ PATIL:

Lucky. I thought we were done with this, honestly. That maybe I was just being paranoid...

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

CASUAL -Is it paranoia?

PROFESSIONAL -Why paranoid?

 

RYDER:

What is there to be paranoid about?

 

RAJ PATIL:

We've had three malfunctions in the past week.

 

RYDER:

That's not good. Sorry, understatement.

 

RAJ PATIL:

Yeah. (Sighs.) And now I have more repairs.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -This has to stop.

LOGICAL -Did you report this?

 

RYDER:

Did you talk to security about this?

 

 

RAJ PATIL:

How can I? For all I know, someone in security is the one doing this! I've scanned all the potential sabotage areas I can think of, but I don't know who to trust anymore.

 

RYDER:

Sounds like a lot went down before the Hyperion docked.

 

RAJ PATIL:

Yeah, I guess. Wait—that's it. You can't possibly be involved in this. You weren't even here during the mutiny. Would you—if you have time, maybe you could help me? If they start hitting critical  systems...

 

RYDER:

Sure thing. What can I do?

 

RAJ PATIL:

If you could scan these other panels while I fix this one, that'd really help. I've sent the locations to your omni-tool. Just send me the data when you're done.

 

[Ryder has to investigate the panels in the Operations Center, Militia, and Pathfinder HQ sites.]

 

RAJ PATIL (COMM):

No, I'm fine. And I don't know—it just blew up.

 

KESH (COMM):

Find out why. Be careful.

 

[Ryder first scans the panel on Colonial Affairs’s deck.]

 

SAM:

Scanning power junction relays. The panel is malfunctioning. Without more data, I cannot determine if this is a normal malfunction or sabotage.

 

RYDER:

I'll just disable power to the panel until Raj can check it out.

 

[Ryder goes back to Operations Center, walks down the ramp, and scans the panel to its left.]

 

SAM:

Pathfinder, to cover their tracks, the saboteur is overloading power to this panel from another junction relay. You can scan and trace the connective wiring to locate the surrogate panel.

 

[Ryder can scan the panel in the Milita site, then proceed to scan the one in the Pathfinder HQ site (also known as Tann's office).]

 

SAM:

Scan and trace the wiring the locate the panel that the saboteur used.

 

[Ryder follows the wiring and scans a panel near Kesh’s office.]

 

RAJ PATIL (COMM):

Pathfinder, I received the data from SAM. It really is sabotage.

 

RYDER:

Any idea as to who it might be?

 

RAJ PATIL (COMM):

Yeah. All these panels were worked on by Zarah. I just can't believe it.

 

SAM:

Security video logs confirm that Zarah Kellus worked on these panels, as well as the one Raj Patil encountered.

 

RYDER:

Well, shit. Any idea where she is now?

 

SAM:

Kellus is currently working on a panel on the Hyperion main deck.

 

[As Ryder leaves, he hears Melo—the salarian technician on the main bridge—talking.]

 

 

 

MELO:

Kesh, this is Melo. The console for the secondary management system is mixed. Everything checks out. It should sync up with the Hyperion's remote consoles. Moving on to the next thing on my list.

 

[Cora is found near the tram, using her omni-tool. She stops what she’s doing when Ryder comes to talk to her.]

 

RYDER:

Hey, there.

 

CORA:

You okay? Those guys really grilled you. And Addison. First Pathfinder they've seen in over a year, all she can do is question your competence?

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -Addison wasn't my favorite.

LOGICAL -Her reaction's understandable.

CASUAL -Which one was Addison?

PROFESSIONAL -Nothing I couldn't handle.

 

RYDER:

I expected something like that. I can handle the pressure.

 

CORA:

I worked out logistics with Director Tann. They're giving us a ship and crew. He said their best is taking care of it.

 

RYDER:

I still need to head back to the ark and check in with SAM.

 

CORA:

Sounds good. While you're there, maybe see how your sister is doing.

 

[Ryder takes the tram leading to the Hyperion Habitation Deck. He arrives in the Atrium, where several crew members are talking.]

 

CREW 1:

What's the latest about waking people up?

 

CREW 2:

We're in a holding pattern. Word is that the Nexus doesn't have enough room.

 

CREW 1:

But they've been here for like a year, haven't they?

 

CREW 2:

Yeah. I guess it didn't go so well.

 

[Ryder finds Zarah Kellus near a panel.]

 

RYDER:

Zarah Kellus?

 

ZARAH KELLUS:

Yes?

 

RYDER:

I have evidence you've been sabotaging the Nexus.

 

ZARAH KELLUS:

What? No! I'd never—I've been looking into this myself. I have the scans to prove it! Here—I'll transfer the scans I took to your omni-tool.

 

RYDER:

Funny. Raj was investigating the same thing—and it led us to you.

 

ZARAH KELLUS:

My scans point at Raj as the one... so unless someone was setting us both up, I just don't understand.

 

SAM (PRIVATE):

The data Miss Kellus has accumulated is strangely similar to Mr Patil's. A third party seems likely.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

CASUAL -You’ve been set up.

PROFESSIONAL -Decoy tactic?

 

RYDER:

The real saboteur could be setting you both up.

 

ZARAH KELLUS:

Because we both figured out something was going on? That would make sense. It's better than thinking Raj could have done this. But it means all the data I have is useless. Wish I had access to the security cams. I bet we could find something there.

 

RYDER:

You stay put, so whoever did this doesn't realize we're on to them. I'll check out the security cams.

 

[Ryder contacts Raj.]

 

RYDER:

Raj, you there?

 

RAJ PATIL (COMM):

Yes. How did it go? Is it-is it really her?

 

RYDER:

Wasn't her. She had "proof" pointing at you. I figure someone's been messing with you both. Just keep a low profile and don't talk to anyone. I'm on it.

 

[Ryder goes back to the Nexus’s Operations Center to check the security footage. The first footage shows a grey static-filled screen.]

 

RYDER:

The file is useless. Let's check another.

 

[Ryder checks another file. The result is the same.]

 

RYDER:

And another scrambled file.

 

 

SAM:

Coincidence seems unlikely.

 

RYDER:

Let's check another.

 

[This time the screen shows images, but they’re blurry.]

 

RYDER:

This file is also corrupted. Definitely not a coincidence. You'd need pretty high clearance to mess with the security camera files. Someone working for Kandros, maybe.

 

SAM:

That is the most probable scenario.

 

RYDER:

Think you can get enough out of the files to find a match using biometric scans, SAM?

 

SAM:

The files were badly scrambled, but if I combine all the available identifiers, it might work. Based on the limited information available, we are looking for a human male assigned either to the Nexus or Hyperion. You will need to conduct scans from close proximity.

 

RYDER:

Got it.

 

[Ryder goes to the Militia site, scans a man working for Nexus security.]

 

 

SAM:

Inaccurate match.

 

[Ryder goes below the Colonial Affairs deck and scans another man working for Nexus security.]

 

SAM:

Negative match.

 

[Ryder goes to the Hyperion Habitation Deck to scan members of Nexus security transferred to the Hyperion. He begins by scanning a man standing guard outside of the tram.]

 

SAM:

Inaccurate match.

 

[As he makes his way to the Hyperion's Atrium, he sees a man kneeling near a panel. Ryder scans him. It's a match.]

 

SAM:

Scan results show a partial positive. Target is most likely suspect.

 

RYDER:

Who is he?

 

SAM:

Dale Atkins. Reports to Kandros' department. Assigned to station security.

 

[Ryder approaches Atkins, who remains kneeling with his back turned.]

 

RYDER:

Dale Atkins, right? We need to talk.

 

DALE ATKINS:

Look, not to be rude, but I have work to do...

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

CASUAL -Is that what you call it?

PROFESSIONAL -I don’t think so.

 

RYDER:

We know what you've been up to. You're done here.

 

DALE ATKINS:

I-I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just doing my job, that's all!

 

RYDER:

Proof says you've been up to no good.

 

DALE ATKINS:

Figures. Screw this. Screw all you hypocrites on this station. You weren't here when they kicked out our loved ones. Mutiny? We just wanted answers. My sister is out there! I don't even know if she's alive or...

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -I sympathize, but...

LOGICAL -Your actions are unforgivable.

 

RYDER:

I'm sorry for what happened, but setting explosives isn't the answer.

 

DALE ATKINS:

Neither was sending people into exile because they didn't agree with policy. (Sighs.) I don't care what you think. The mutiny leaders were right to demand to know what was going on.

 

RYDER:

You could have hurt people. Killed them.

 

DALE ATKINS:

Like those who got killed when the leadership had the krogan stomp on my friends? I'm done talking. I confess: it was me. Do whatever you want.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -You need to go.

LOGICAL -Not up to me.

 

RYDER:

Not my call. The Nexus leaders will make that decision.

 

DALE ATKINS:

That lot, make a decision? That'll be the day.

 

[With that finished, Ryder continues to the Hyperion Atrium. There he spots the Hyperion pilot (Lani) and captain (Dunn). He first approaches Lani, who is standing by a panel close to the one Zarah Kellus was inspecting.]

 

LANI:

Pathfinder. It's good to see you. Word is there's been trouble on the station...

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

CASUAL -It’ll get better.

PROFESSIONAL -Where’d you hear that?

 

RYDER:

We're here now. It'll get better.

 

 

LANI:

That's what I've been telling people. You're here now! As soon as we establish outposts, everything will even out. I'm sure of it.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-And your family?

-Why are you here?

-What's it like here?

 

RYDER:

What about your family?

 

LANI:

I'm an orphan. My parents died on the Mindoir colony when it was attacked years ago. No siblings. I left friends and some distant relatives behind, but I have friends here, too. I love piloting, but I like the idea of going back to my roots and farming like my parents did. Someday.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-And your family?

-Why are you here?

-What's it like here?

 

RYDER:

Why did you join the Initiative?

 

LANI:

Ah, the most popular question on the station. Honestly, I wouldn't have known about this project if Nozomi hadn't reached out to me.

 

RYDER:

Nozomi?

 

LANI:

Captain Dunn. Of all the captains I've piloted for, she's the best. I've always been a wanderer at heart. When she asked me to be her pilot... how could I say no to the adventure of a lifetime?

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-And your family?

-Why are you here?

-What's it like here?

 

RYDER:

How do you feel about all this now that we're here?

 

 

 

LANI:

Hopeful. I know, it's a rose-colored outlook, but... Someone's gotta keep the positivity coming, right?

 

RYDER:

Have to go now. See you later.

 

LANI:

Take care.

 

[Captain Dunn is standing on the far side of the Atrium. Ryder now walks toward her.]

 

CAPTAIN DUNN:

Ryder.

 

RYDER:

You're not on the bridge, Captain?

 

CAPTAIN DUNN:

We powered it down. Can't afford to waste energy. Though cryo bay and SAM Node are exempt. And I told them to keep their hands off Alec's quarters. You have access now.

 

RYDER:

Thanks.

 

CAPTAIN DUNN:

Hey—sorry about your father. He was really good at what he did. Just not so good at working with people. He was right about going planetside, though.

 

RYDER - dialogues options:

EMOTIONAL -I'll miss him.

LOGICAL -I didn't really know him.

CASUAL -He was difficult.

PROFESSIONAL -Only work mattered to him.

 

RYDER:

I wish he were still here. There's so much he would have taught me.

 

CAPTAIN DUNN:

You'll do fine. You're off to a good start. If there's anything else I can help with, let me know.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Your role

-Expectations

-Joining the Initiative

 

RYDER:

Now that the Hyperion is docked, what will you do?

 

CAPTAIN DUNN:

Normally I'd supervise thawing out the colonists, but that's been put on hold. I hear you're the one helping resolve the issue. Good luck with that.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Your role

-Expectations

-Joining the Initiative

 

RYDER:

If someone had told you that you'd be in the Andromeda cluster, even five years ago...

 

CAPTAIN DUNN:

Are you kidding me? I'd have laughed them out of the quadrant. Although the way things are now isn't exactly what I was hoping for, either. We all knew there was a possibility on arrival of less than ideal circumstances. When you sign up, you hope for the best and plan for the worst.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-Your role

-Expectations

-Joining the Initiative

 

RYDER:

Why did you join the Initiative? We're a long way from home...

 

CAPTAIN DUNN:

How could I not? I love my job. Coming here, all this... it was just a logical extension of what I already do. Sailing through new stars, discovering new worlds... what self-respecting explorer could pass that up?

 

RYDER:

Thanks for the talk.

 

CAPTAIN DUNN:

All right. I have requests to submit, administrators to harass, and people to wake up. I'd better get to it. Good luck out there.

 

[Ryder leaves the Atrium, passes by SAM Node to arrive at Alec’s quarters. It’s guarded by a man who nods at Ryder. In Alec’s quarters, directly to the right of the entrance is a wall of shelves displaying weapons. Ryder examines Alec’s sidearm.]

 

SAM:

Your father's first sidearm. A memento of his early Alliance service.

 

RYDER:

I bet that saw plenty of action.

SAM:

Alec’s first kill occured in combat during the First Contact War.

 

RYDER:

Back when turians were the enemy. Crazy times.

 

[There is a shelf above the bed in the corner across from the entrance. Ryder can pick up a model of the Normandy SR-2. A partition to the left of the entrance doubles as a library. Ryder examines the books.]

 

RYDER:

Printed books?

 

SAM:

Reproductions of Lewis and Clark’s journals, detailing their expedition in the 19th century.

 

RYDER:

Explains Dad’s interest. They were pathfinders, too.

 

[Behind the partition-library is the kitchen, where Ryder notices a coffee machine.]

 

RYDER:

(Laughs.) The coffee machine Mom got for Dad. He was so busy designing you—needed the caffeine.

 

SAM:

I did not realize I owed my existence to a bean.

 

RYDER:

And now you know what humility feels like.

 

[In the center of the far wall past the kitchen area is the Archive System: a desk with multiple screens on top.]

 

RYDER:

What’s on here, SAM?

 

SAM:

Your father’s personal logs. Several of them are encrypted.

 

RYDER - Investigate dialogues options:

-General Logs

-Encrypted Log #1

-Encrypted Log #2

[Ryder selects General Logs.]

 

GENERAL LOGS OPTIONS:

-Milky Way departure

-Asari archaeologist

-Final entry

 

ALEC RYDER:

The day is finally here. We’re pushing off from Earth. We’ll jump through a few relays first, then we hunker down for the long trip across dark space. It’s daunting, thinking about all the hopes and dreams aboard the Hyperion. I certainly have my own. I wasn’t the husband or father I should’ve been. Here’s hoping 600 years can change a man.

 

GENERAL LOGS OPTIONS:

-Milky Way departure

-Asari archaeologist: Dr. Liara T’Soni

-Final entry

 

ALEC RYDER:

Sam, this is a reminder about Dr. Liara T’Soni—she’s an asari archeologist I corresponded with a few years back. She’s got experience studying ancient cultures. Make sure the team gets her research. Could be useful in Andromeda.

 

RYDER:

Pretty sure my sister mentioned Dr. T’Soni. An expert on Protheans, I think?

 

SAM:

I have loaded Dr. T’Soni’s research onto datapads.

 

[Ryder listens to Dr. T’Soni Message #1.]

 

DR. T’SONI:

Hello, Alec—this is Dr. T’Soni. I’m flattered you contacted me. Most scientists dismiss my work. But I’m young and asari, and they’re getting older, so we’ll see who has the final word. (Laughs.) In the meantime, I’m happy to pass along my research. I hope your team finds it useful.

 

[Ryder listens to Dr. T’Soni Message #2.]

 

DR. T’SONI:

Hello, Alec. I received your message. I must say, the thought of exploring another galaxy has my head spinning. I’m honestly not sure how people could survive a trip like that. And anyway, I couldn’t bear to leave the Milky Way behind. There’s so much about the Protheans I still hope to learn here, so much potential wisdom to tap. I wish you much good luck and future success.

 

 

 

 

GENERAL LOGS OPTIONS:

-Milky Way departure

-Asari archaeologist: Dr. Liara T’Soni

-Final entry

 

ALEC RYDER:

Dunn’s agreed to a scouting mission on Habitat 7. I’m gearing up now. I’m worried about Sara. Dr. T’Perro says she’ll be fine, but… she’s my daughter. How can I not worry? I hate to leave her like this. It’s these moments when you wish you’d told your children you loved them more often. Or ever. Which brings me to the tough part. Kids, if anything happens to me, there are… things you’re going to find out. I hope you’ll understand.

 

[Ryder tries to listen to one of the encrypted logs.]

 

SAM:

That log is inaccessible at this time.

 

[There is an audio excerpt on the Archive Systems desk. Ryder can listen to it.]

 

DR. T’SONI:

When studying a dead race, the most obvious problem is the lack of an observable population. This raises the question: When is a species truly extinct? The Prothean civilization spanned the galaxy, and it took centuries to confirm that all members of the species really had died out. While it's possible that living Protheans may be found in a hidden pocket of the galaxy one day, the chances are statistically trivial. Once an extinction is confirmed, the study's nature moves from sociology to exo-archeology.

 

[Ryder steps away. Back on a table between the Archive Systems and the bed is an audio excerpt. Ryder can listen to it.]

 

DR. T’SONI:

I’m Dr. Liara T’Soni, and I’ve spent several decades researching ancient Protheans. It’s common knowledge that the Protheans were an advanced race that flourished in the Milky Way about 50 000 years ago, then went extinct. Even at the time of this writing—the year 2182–their culture remains a mystery. During my studies, I’ve developed some practices that can be used when analyzing any ancient culture. I hope they may prove useful for the research community.

 

[Ryder leaves the room to go to SAM Node.]

MASS EFFECT 
BLOCKING DRAFT 10/12/2011 

Based on Mass Effect [2007] 

Revised 11/19/2011m.k.studio8@gmail.com 


EXT. SPACE 

Blackness. Stars fade in. The sun slowly rises behind a darkplanet. 

SUPERIMPOSITION: 

In the year 2148, explorers on Mars discovered the remains ofan ancient spacefaring civilization, the Protheans. In the 
decades that followed, mysterious artifacts revealedstartling new technologies, enabling travel to the furtheststars. The basis for this incredible technology was a forcethat controlled the very fabric of space and time. Theycalled it the greatest discovery in human history. Thecivilizations of the galaxy call it... 

EXT. SPACE 

Sunlight crosses the planet’s horizon. There is a blindinglight. 

TITLE CARD: MASS EFFECT. 

EXT. SPACE - MORNING 

A Mass Relay, a huge transportation station with massiveenergy at it’s center. An Alliance Starship, the NORMANDY, 
enters from it with a BANG. It flies toward the planet EdenPrime. 

INT. NORMANDY, COMMAND DECK 

COMMANDER SHEPARD, early 30’s in military attire, walksthrough the command deck. Crew members work at stations tohis left and right. He passes by JOKER, mid 20’s in pilot 
gear. 

SHEPARD 
Aren’t you supposed to be flyingthis ship? 

JOKER 
A three hour flight, I walk awayfor two minutes! Two! 

SHEPARD 
I wasn’t complaining. I actuallyfeel safer. 


2. 

JOKER 
Ha. Ha. We’ll see whose laughingafter Captain Anderson and Nihlushave a word with you. 

SHEPARD 
Looking forward to it. 

INT. NORMANDY, CAPTAINS QUARTERS 

Shepard enters the Captain’s Quarters. The door shuts behindhim. CAPTAIN ANDERSON, late 40’s military general, andNIHLUS, a turian spectre, stand waiting. Turians are 6 feet 
tall, bipedal with avian characteristics, mandibles aroundtheir mouths, and usually wear armour. 

NIHLUS 
Commander Shepard. 

SHEPARD 
Nihlus. Captain Anderson. 

Nihlus and Anderson nod. 

NIHLUS 
This planet, Eden Prime, it means alot to you, doesn’t it? 

SHEPARD 
To me? 

NIHLUS 
To you, Captain Anderson, Earth. Asymbol that humanity is finallyable to not just colonize worlds,
but protect them. 

SHEPARD 
If you’ve got something to say, sayit. 

The ship ROCKS. The Normandy enters Eden Prime’s atmosphere.
Shepard looks out the window at blue skies. 

ANDERSON 
It’s about time we told you what’sreally going on. 

Shepard walks up to Nihlus. 


3. 

SHEPARD 
When a turian spectre boards yourship during a simple resupplymission, there’s obviously moregoing on, and about time you told 
me. 

NIHLUS 
By order of the Council, we’remaking a covert pick-up. 

ANDERSON 
A human colony discovered anancient beacon. The Normandy’sstealth systems made our crew theperfect fit for this mission. 

SHEPARD 
And this beacon... 

NIHLUS 
Prothean. 

The ship ROCKS again. The blue skies have turned to storms. 

ANDERSON 
There hasn’t been a discovery ofthis magnitude since we originallydiscovered the protheansthemselves, back on Mars. 

Joker interrupts through the intercom. 

JOKER 

(intercom)
Captain, you’re going to want tosee this. I’ve patched through toyour personal console. 

Anderson plays a video message. 

ANDERSON 
The ground team. 

EXT. EDEN PRIME, COLONY ENTRANCE - VIDEO MESSAGE 

The video shows Alliance Soldiers on the ground. HugeEXPLOSIONS and debris fly everywhere. Gun fire WHISTLES by.
An ALLIANCE SOLDER holds the camera towards himself. 

ALLIANCE SOLDIER 
We are under attack. Heavycasualties taken.

ALLIANCE SOLDIER (CONT'D) 
We’re not the only ones who know ofthe beacon. I repeat, unknown enemyhas come for the beacon. They cameout of nowhere, and now-

The Alliance soldier is SHOT. A loud MECHANIC GROAN. The 
camera falls and shows other alliance soldiers. They stopfiring and stare into the distance. An explosion turns thecamera. A gigantic starship rises into the clouds, amidst a 
lightning storm. The camera goes static. 

INT. NORMANDY, CAPTAINS QUARTERS 

The video ends. 

ANDERSON 
Joker, status report. 

JOKER 

(intercom)
Next alliance vessel is 30 minutes 
out. 

Anderson looks at Nihlus. 

ANDERSON 
Land close to that transmission 
point. 

NIHLUS 
Go as a group and we’ll be sittingducks. As a small strike team we’ll 
go unnoticed for as long as we can. 

JOKER 

(intercom)
ETA 10 minutes. Stealth systemsengaged. 

EXT. EDEN PRIME, COLONY ENTRANCE - MORNING 

Blue skies have returned, it is peaceful. The Normandy hoversabove the surface, docking bay doors open, Nihlus standing.
Anderson, Shepard, KAIDAN, and an ALLIANCE SOLDIER appearbehind him. 

NIHLUS 
One more thing, Shepard. 

SHEPARD 
Yeah? 


5. 

NIHLUS 
Prove yourself here, and two 
spectres will be bringing thisbeacon back to the council. 

Shepard is shocked. 

SHEPARD 
But, there’s never been a human 
spectre. 

NIHLUS 
So don’t mess this up. Catch you onthe other side. 

Nihlus hops to the ground. The Normandy takes off. 

EXT. EDEN PRIME, EXCAVATION SITE 

The Normandy lands at an excavation site. 

SHEPARD 
I guess Nihlus won’t be joining us. 

ANDERSON 
He prefers to work alone. 

SHEPARD 
Small strike teams indeed. Looks 
like somebody wants to be the hero. 

ANDERSON 
There’s a lot more to being aspectre than heroics. It’s not justabout the success of the mission, 
but how that success is achieved. 
It’s makes you who you are.
Separates the renegades from the 
paragon. 

Shepard, Kaidan and Alliance Soldier hop to the ground. 

ANDERSON (CONT’D)
Get in, investigate the beacon, getout. We’ll be waiting. Good luck. 

The Normandy takes off. The Eden Prime colony lays aheadbeyond a ridge. There are holes dug everywhere. 

KAIDAN 
Someone’s been busy. 

GUNFIRE. ASHLEY WILLIAMS runs over the ridge. 


6. 

Two flying GETH DRONES and a GETH SOLDIER follow behindAshley. The geth trooper is a humanoid bipedal robot. It’sface has a bright light instead of a face. The geth drone is 
a small orb with a gun attached. They shoot at the team. 

Shepard and Kaidan take cover. Alliance Soldier is SHOT andkilled. Ashley dives behind a rock, pinned down. Kaidan drawsfire away while Shepard shoots down the geth drones. Ashleykills the geth trooper. 

Shepard walks toward the ridge. Ashley and Kaidan follow. 

ASHLEY 
Gunnery Chief Ashley Williams, ofthe 212. Where did you come from? Isaw a ship. 

SHEPARD 
That ship is the Normandy, andwe’re not going back until werecover that beacon. 

ASHLEY 
The beacon? There’s no way you’regetting close to that. 

KAIDAN 
We have to. 

ASHLEY 
You’ll have to get by the geth. 
They came from nowhere, blocked oursignals, and-

Shepard clears the ridge. 

Dragon’s teeth, spiked metal structures, ten feet tall, risefrom the ground. Husks, half-human half-machine bodies, laypierced through them. There are dozens of them. 

ASHLEY (CONT’D)
Dragon’s teeth. 

KAIDAN 
I thought those were just a fairytale. 
Or, nightmare. 

The spikes lower. The husks slide off charge Shepard. Hefires at the nearest husk. It falls. 

KAIDAN (CONT’D)
Are they... human? 

Kaidan and Shepard fire at a few husks. 


7. 

SHEPARD 
They used to be. 

ASHLEY 
They used to be my team. Myfriends. 

SHEPARD 
I’m sorry, but we can’t do anything 
now. 

Shepard and Kaidan continue to fire. Ashley reluctantly joinsthem. There’s too many. 

SHEPARD (CONT’D)
We have to get out of here. On me. 

The team sprints through the husks. One grabs Kaidan. Shepardwrestles it off, but two more grab him. Ashley shoots themoff. Running and shooting they make it to the colony 
entrance. 

EXT. EDEN PRIME, BEACON 

The prothean beacon sits near a rocky ledge. Storagecontainers and cranes are everywhere. Nihlus, stands aroundthe corner, back against the wall. SAREN, another turianspectre, studies the beacon, his back turned to Nihlus. 

Nihlus scans the area. The coast is clear. Nihlus chargesforward, weapon aimed and steady. 

Nihlus nears Saren. He slows to a walk and lowers his weapon. 

NIHLUS 
Saren? 

SAREN 
Nihlus. 

Saren turns. Nihlus drops his weapon on a nearby storage 
crate. 

NIHLUS 
This isn’t your mission Saren. 

SAREN 
The council thought you could usesome help on this one. Havinganother spectre around can’t hurt. 


8. 

Nihlus is satisfied with Saren’s answer. He walks past Sarenand looks out beyond the ledge the beacon sits on. A smallship is heading toward them. 

NIHLUS 
I wasn’t expecting to find the gethhere. The council won’t be pleased. 

Nihlus squints. He can’t make out who is coming. 

SAREN 
Don’t worry. 

Saren takes out his pistol and aims it at Nihlus’s back. 

SAREN (CONT’D)
I’ve got it under control. 

INT. EDEN PRIME, COLONY 

Shepard and team walk down a hallway. It’s empty. Officesupplies litter the floor. There are a few Dragon’s teethwith no husks on them. Silence. 

KAIDAN 
It’s as if everyone just,
(beat)
Disappeared. 

SHEPARD 
First we find the beacon, then we 
look for survivors. 

ASHLEY 
Nobody could have survived this. 

There’s a loud GUNSHOT. 

SHEPARD 
Quickly! 

Shepard runs. Dead end. 

He runs another way, but the door is locked. A RUMBLE shakesthe colony. Everyone stops to gain composure. 

Silence. Shepard shoots the door lock and BANG, kicks thedoor open. 


9. 

EXT. EDEN PRIME, BEACON 

Shepard and team spot Saren hopping on board the ship Nihlusspotted. Geth troopers fire from on board. Shepard spotsNihlus’s limp body. 

SHEPARD 
Kaidan, get me a visual. Ashley,
protect the beacon. 

Kaidan runs right while using binoculars to get a visual. 

Ashley takes cover in front of the beacon. 

Shepard slowly advances forward as the ship takes off. Thegeth troopers keep firing, but not at the team. Shepardnotices they’re aiming for the beacon. 

SHEPARD (CONT’D)
Don’t let them destroy the beacon! 

Shepard pushes closer. Kaidan provides cover fire. Ashley ispinned down. A couple stray shots hit the beacon as the shiptakes off. Shepard gets on his radio. 

SHEPARD (CONT’D)
Shepard to Anderson. Beacon secure.
Nihlus didn’t make it. 

The beacon sparks. A loud RUMBLE resonates from within. Thebeacon flashes. Ashley is pulled toward it. 

SHEPARD (CONT’D) 
Ashley! 

Shepard drops his radio. Anderson, muffled, calls out toShepard. Shepard pushes Ashley out of the way. 

KAIDAN 
Commander! 

Shepard is pulled to the front of the beacon. 

SHEPARD 
Stay... back... 

Kaidan and Ashley watch as Shepard is pulled into the air. Aseries of images flash before he eyes. He drops to theground. 

The beacon bursts apart. Debris from the beacon iseverywhere. Nihlus’s and Shepard’s body lay within feet ofeach other in front of the beacon. 


10. 

Ashley gives Shepard CPR. Kaidan grabs the radio. 

KAIDAN 
Shepard is down. Need an evac stat. 

ANDERSON 
What the hell happened down there? 

KAIDAN 
I don’t know, Captain. I don’tknow. 

EXT. CITADEL - DAY 

The Normandy flies toward the Citadel, a massive spacestation. Five wards, fifty kilometers long, branch off from acenter ring, like a five pointed star. At the center of thering is the citadel tower. 

EXT. CITADEL, HANGER 

The Normandy docks in the citadel hanger. 

INT. CITADEL, PRESIDIUM 

The Presidium is the center ring of the Citadel. It is abeautiful area including businesses, shops, trees, lakes, andlots of aliens. 

Shepard, Anderson, and ambassador UDINA walk toward thecitadel tower in the distance. They are ants among a city. 

INT. CITADEL TOWER 

Shepard, Anderson, and Udina exit an elevator and walk upsteps leading to the Citadel Council. Shepard bumps into aKEEPER, a short green alien with four legs and two arms. 

SHEPARD 
Damn Keepers. 

The keeper doesn’t flinch. It continues on it’s way. 

ANDERSON 
The Keepers were before the asarifirst discovered the Citadel. Theydon’t mind us, and we would do well 
to not mind them. 


11. 

SHEPARD 
Well they should watch wherethey’re going. 

UDINA 
The Keepers keep this placerunning. If not for them, therewould be no Citadel, and no reportyou’d have to make in two minutes! 

SHEPARD 
I’m ready. 

Shepard stumbles on the next step. 

UDINA 
I need you focused. Do not make me 
look bad. We are so close to 
getting a human on the council. 

Shepard stumbles again but recovers nicely. 

ANDERSON 
Dr. Chakwas may have cleared you tobe here but I’m not certain you’rerecovered from that beacon 
encounter. I need you in top formif you’re going to be with us,
especially with Udina pulling us afavor to get this hearing scheduledso quickly. 

UDINA 
Don’t make me regret doing that.

(beat)
Now, the council is a fickle group.
I’ve read your report. I’ll do thetalking. 

INT. CITADEL, COUNCIL CHAMBER 

Shepard reaches the Citadel council. The council is made upof a TURIAN COUNCILOR, ASARI COUNCILOR, and SALARIAN 
COUNCILOR. 

The salarian is a bipedal amphibian the size a human butthinner, and with dual horns coming off the back of it’s head 

The asari are a mono-gender race with similar physique tohuman females, blue-toned skin, and instead of hair have 
slicked-back appendages that form the back of their head. 


12. 

The council sits on a platform in public space. Onlookerswatch the proceedings. Saren is connected via hologram. 

TURIAN COUNCILOR 
Commander Shepard. Pleased to seeyou’re alright. 

Shepard nods. 

TURIAN COUNCILOR (CONT’D)
That said, Nihlus is dead, the 
prothean beacon is destroyed, andyour report says the geth have 
returned. This is not good. 

ASARI COUNCILOR 
Geth haven’t traveled outside the 
Veil in two centuries. 

TURIAN COUNCILOR 
Not to mention, the C-Sec 
investigation of Saren has comeback with no evidence to supportyour charge of treason. 

Shepard shakes his head. 

UDINA 
Shepard heard the gunshot, andKaidan witnessed Saren fleeing thescene! 

SALARIAN COUNCILOR 
I’ve read the report. Kaidanwitnessed a turian that looked like 
Saren, but can not be one-hundred 
percent certain. 

From the hologram, Saren rolls his eyes. 

SAREN 
I resent these accusations. Nihlus 
was a fellow spectre, and a friend. 

Captain Anderson pounds his fist on the podium. 

ANDERSON 
Which is why he let his guard down! 

Udina gives Anderson a glare. 


13. 

SAREN 
Captain Anderson, you always seemedto be involved when humanity makesfalse charges against me. And thistime you brought Commander Shepard.
Wasn’t destroying the beaconenough, commander? 

SHEPARD 
You’re the one who destroyed thebeacon, then left me to be framed! 

SAREN 
Sure, shift the blame to cover-upyour own failures. Just likeCaptain Anderson. He’s taught youwell. 

SHEPARD 
I’ll teach you-

SAREN 
Learn your place in the galaxy,
human. You’re not ready to join thecouncil. You’re not even ready tojoin the spectres. 

UDINA 
He has no right to say that! It isnot his decision! 

The Council turns to Saren. 

ASARI COUNCILOR 
Shepard’s admission into thespectres is not the purpose of thismeeting. 

SAREN 
This meeting has no purpose! Thehumans are wasting your time,
councilor. And mine. 

ANDERSON 
You can’t hide behind the council 
forever. And we haven’t addressed 
Shepard’s vision. The one caused bythe beacon. 

Shepard closes his eyes. The images race through his head. 


14. 

SHEPARD 
I saw synthetics. Machines. Gethmaybe? They were... butcheringpeople. 

SAREN 
Are we allowing dreams intoevidence now? How can I defend myinnocence against this kind oftestimony? 

TURIAN COUNCILOR 
I agree. Our decisions must bebased on facts and evidence. Not 
imaginings and speculations. 

SALARIAN COUNCILOR 
If there is nothing else you haveto say. This trail is adjourned. 

Anderson steps away from the podium. Udina shakes his head.
Shepard stares back at Saren. 

ASARI COUNCILOR 
Then the council finds no 
connection between Saren and the 
geth. Nihlus may have been lost, 
but it seems Shepard did what hecould to save him and the beacon. 

SAREN 
I’m glad to see justice has beenserved. 

Saren’s hologram shuts off. Udina has left the podium.
Shepard still stands in disbelief. 

INT. CITADEL, PRESIDIUM 

Anderson, Shepard, and Udina talk in the Presidium in frontof a huge mass relay statue. A keeper walks near them andopens up a vent in the floor and adjusts some connections. 

UDINA 
It was a mistake bringing you inthere, Anderson. You have too much 
history with Saren. It made thecouncil question our motives. 

ANDERSON 
Saren’s a specter, one of the best.
But if he’s gone rogue there’d be 
only one reason why. 


15. 

The keeper shuts the vent, takes a few steps and opensanother. Shepard and Anderson have to get out of the way. 

ANDERSON (CONT’D)
To exterminate the entire human 
race. 

Udina rolls his eyes. 

ANDERSON (CONT’D)
I don’t know what else was in that 
beacon, but you can be sure Sarenwill find a way to use it againstour ships, colonies, maybe evenEarth. 

UDINA 
Even if he’s half as dangerous asyou say, he’s virtuallyuntouchable. He’s a spectre. 

The keeper walks up the mass relay statue and attempts tomove it. The keeper is not strong, it doesn’t budge. 

ANDERSON 
I have a contact in C-Sec. He was 
leading their own investigation ofSaren. It’s as good a place to 
start as any. 

UDINA 
I will not have the council use 
your history with Saren as anexcuse to ignore anything we turnup. Shepard will handle it. 

SHEPARD 
I’ll take care of it. 

INT. CITADEL, C-SEC - LATER 

Shepard walks in to C-Sec, the Citadel police station. 

CONRAD VERNER is walking out. He blocks Shepard’s path. 

CONRAD 
Commander Shepard? The Hero of EdenPrime! It’s an honor! 

Shepard tries to step forward, but Conrad won’t budge. 

SHEPARD 
Uh, do I know you? 


16. 

CONRAD 
No, no. I’m just a fan. You’rebiggest fan! The names Conrad 
Verner. 

Shepard tries to dodge him. Conrad steps in front of himagain. 

SHEPARD 
That’s great Conrad, but I‘m kinda 
busy right now. 

CONRAD 
I heard you killed a hundred Geth! 

SHEPARD 
Right... 

Shepard physically moves Conrad out of the way. 

SHEPARD (CONT’D)
I really need to be going, Conrad. 

CONRAD 
Next time then! Maybe I’ll get yourautograph! The pleasures all mine! 

Shepard continues into C-Sec. GARRUS, a turian, is standing 
impatiently. 

SHEPARD 
You must be Garrus. 

GARRUS 
Where’s Anderson? 

SHEPARD 
Too much baggage with Saren. 

GARRUS 
You don’t have to tell me. 

Shepard is puzzled. 

GARRUS (CONT’D)
Anderson was almost a spectre once.
His final trial was with Saren. 

SHEPARD 
I’m guessing something went wrong. 


17. 

GARRUS 
Lots of civilians died that day.
Because of Saren’s recklessness 
Anderson didn’t become a spectre,
and Saren came out looking golden.
You connect the dots. 

SHEPARD 
How do you know all this? 

GARRUS 
You work in C-Sec for long enough,
you hear things. 

SHEPARD 
So I take it you’re not a fan ofSaren? 

Garrus shrugs, he’s not a fan. 

GARRUS 
I have one lead. Guy named Fist,
Saren’s informant. A quarian namedTali setup a meeting with him,
thinking he’s the Shadow Broker. 

SHEPARD 
What kind of information could Tali 
have? 

GARRUS 
Whatever it is, Saren is scared of 
it leaking out, otherwise hewouldn’t have Fist involved 
pretending to be the Shadow Broker. 

SHEPARD 
Where can I find Fist? 

GARRUS 
Oh no. This may be your show, butI’m coming with you. Saren is adisgrace to my people, and thecouncil. Even if they don’t see it 
yet. 

Shepard extends his hand. 

SHEPARD 
Welcome aboard. 


18. 

INT. CITADEL, CHORA’S DEN - NIGHT 

A seedy nightclub. Asari strippers captivate locals.
Salarians gamble. Humans drink at the bar. People dancing. 

WREX, a hulking Krogan with a scar down the right side of hisface, makes his way to the back of the club. Krogan arereptilian bipeds that stands seven feet tall, and covered in 
armor. 

At the back of the club is a door with a NO ADMITTANCE signposted. A KROGAN BODYGUARD blocks the door. He notices Wrexapproaching. 

KROGAN BODYGUARD 
Back off Wrex, Fist knows you’recoming. 

WREX 
Fist leaves now if he even wants a 
chance to live. 

KROGAN BODYGUARD 
Nobody gets in to see Fist rightnow. Especially you. End of story. 

WREX 
This story’s just beginning. 

KROGAN BODYGUARD 
Do you want me to escort you out? 

Wrex takes a step back. 

WREX 
I want you to try. 

Wrex turns around to leave, then swings back around andknocks the bodyguard out cold. The Krogan Bodyguard falls andhis guns goes off. People start screaming, running. Chaos inthe bar. 

Other bodyguards reveal themselves and take shots at Wrex.
Wrex BARGES through the NO ADMITTANCE door and shuts itbehind him. 

Garrus and Shepard show up at the front entrance of Chora’s 
Den. Everyone streams out past them. 

GARRUS 
This can’t be coincidence. 

SHEPARD 
Someone else must be after Tali! 


19. 

Shepard leads while Garrus falls back. Two Krogan bodyguardsrun toward Shepard. Shepard takes one down. Garrus hits theother with his sniper rifle. Shepard turns. 

SHEPARD (CONT’D)
I could have taken him. 

Garrus is pushed to the side by a biotic shockwave of 
enormous power. 

An asari bodyguard raises her hands to Shepard and shootsanother biotic shockwave in his direction. 

Shepard leaps out of the way. He lands at the feat of aturian bodyguard. Shepard smiles uneasily. Another shockwave 
blast. The turian and Shepard are both knocked back. 

The asari bodyguard walks up to Shepard and puts her hand inhis face, as threatening as a gun. She laughs in contempt ofShepard. She motions to summon another shockwave blast when 
she’s SHOT. Shepard stands up. Garrus is the only otherperson left standing in the club. 

SHEPARD (CONT’D)
You’re handy to have around. 

GARRUS 
Back of the club. Let’s go. 

Shepard looks at the NO ADMITTANCE door. 

GARRUS (CONT’D)
Fist will be in there. 

INT. CITADEL, FIST’S OFFICE 

FIST, a human, is speaking with TALI, the quarian. Tali has a 
human physique but lives in a bio-suit. Her face is blocked 
under a mask. Tali sits at a table while Fist circles her. 

FIST 
Giving me the data is the onlychance you have of leaving herealive. 

TALI 
No Shadow Broker. No info. I made a 
deal. 

Fist flexes his hands to show off his brass knuckles. 


20. 

FIST 
Smart little engineer, so far fromhome. Aren’t you a little out ofyour league? 

Tali draws her weapon but Fist knocks it aside. CRASH. Fistis startled backwards. Tali jumps up. FOOTSTEPS. Wrex appearscoming up a stairwell. His gun is trained toward Tali andFist. They are too close together to know who he aims at. 

WREX 
Step away from the quarian. 

FIST 
I have credits. Lots. Or... did youcome for the quarian? Take her. 
She’ll only speak to the ShadowBroker anyway. 

Another CRASH. Shepard and Garrus enter. 

GARRUS 
Wrex? What are you doing here? 

Wrex shoots Fist. 

WREX 
Payment. 

SHEPARD 
Payment? 

WREX 
You don’t imitate the Shadow Broker 
and live to tell the tale. Dead or 
Alive contract. 

SHEPARD 
We could have arrested him alive! 

WREX 
That’s what I was afraid of. I 
don’t get paid for detainment. 

GARRUS 
You can’t just go around shootingpeople! 

WREX 
It was the only contract I hadleft. I don’t leave jobs halffinished. 

Tali is frazzled by the whole situation. 


21. 

TALI 
I’m... not sure what to say. Thankyou for saving me though. I owe 
you. 

She reaches into her pocket and takes out a data chip. SheTosses it over to Wrex. Wrex holds the chip, not sure what todo with it. 

WREX 
I already got paid. Just doing myjob. You don’t owe me anything. 

SHEPARD 
Then join us. 

Garrus is appalled. 

GARRUS 
Join us? 

WREX 
Join you? 

SHEPARD 
I need that chip, and you need acontract. I can’t pay you, but Ican I can offer you the opportunityto hunt down a rogue spectre. 

GARRUS 
Wrex is aggressive, unpredictableand dangerous. C-Sec won’t even 
bother with him! 

WREX 
Ha! 

SHEPARD 
What do you say? 

WREX 
You have my attention, for now. Letme know when you’re ready to headof this piece of metal. 

TALI 
What about me? 

SHEPARD 
Head back to the Flotilla. It’s 
less dangerous there. 


22. 

TALI 
Danger? I salvaged that chip fromthe memory core of a live Geth.
Saren is using their help and you’dbe well off to have a Geth experton hand. Besides, I’m on mypilgrimage. If I head back now,
with nothing, they won’t even 
accept my return. 

GARRUS 
Shepard, the quarians created the 
geth. They lost their homeworld to 
them in the great Geth Uprising,
but, they still know more aboutthem then anybody else. 

Shepard thinks it over. 

SHEPARD 
Let’s hear that recording first. 

INT. CITADEL COUNCIL - LATER 

The Council waits impatiently. Udina and Anderson try toremain calm. 

UDINA 
I assure you, Councilors, Shepardwill be but a minute more. 

Udina turns to Anderson. 

UDINA (CONT’D)
Where’s Shepard? Every second he’snot here makes me look worse. This 
better be worth it, or you’re outof a job. Do you even know thedamage he caused in Chora’s Den? 

ANDERSON 
He would never make an emergencyrequest like this unless it waswarranted. 

Shepard leads Tali and Garrus running into the councilchamber. He arrives next to Anderson and Udina out of breath. 

TURIAN COUNCILOR 
This trial has been in session for 
ten minutes commander, and not a 
meaningful word spoken. 


23. 

Shepard can barely speak. 

SHEPARD 
Listen. 

Shepard plays Tali’s data chip. 

SAREN (RECORDING)
Eden Prime was a major victory. Thebeacon has brought us one stepcloser to finding the Conduit. 

UNKOWN (RECORDING)
And one step closer to the returnof the Reapers. 

The Council is shocked. Udina breathes a sigh of relief andAnderson smiles, proud of Shepard. 

SALARIAN COUNCILOR 
Where was this found? 

Tali steps forward. 

TALI 
Extracted from a Geth memory corebefore the self-destruct kicked in. 

Udina gains confidence. 

UDINA 
You wanted proof of Saren’streachery. There it is. 

The council debates for a moment. 

TURIAN COUNCILOR 
Saren is stripped of his spectrestatus effective immediately. Allefforts will be made for his arrest 
and have him answer for his crimes. 

ASARI COUNCILOR 
I recognize the other voice, theone speaking with Saren. MatriarchBenezia. She is an asari, a 
powerful biotic, and a spiritualleader with many followers. Shewill be of great assistance toSaren if she’s working with him. 


24. 

SALARIAN COUNCILOR 

I’m more interested in these... 

Reapers. What do you know about

them. 

Udina turns to Shepard. Shepard turns to Tali. Tali speaks. 

TALI 

According to the geth memory core,

the Reapers were a hyper advanced

machine race that existed 50,000 

years ago. Reapers hunted the

protheans to total extinction, 

then... vanished. The geth see the 

Reapers as Gods, the pinnacle of

non-organic life. And they believe

Saren knows how to bring the

Reapers back, most likely through

the Conduit. 

SHEPARD 

That’s it. That’s what I saw! The 

beacon transferred... images?

Memories maybe, of the protheans

being wiped out by the Reapers! 

ANDERSON 

You must send the Citadel Fleet to 

find Saren. Obviously this Conduit

is the key to bringing back the

Reapers. 

The Salarian council shakes his head. 

SALARIAN COUNCILOR 

We don’t even know what the Conduit 

is. 

TURIAN COUNCILOR 

I’ve heard of Reapers before, but

listen to what you’re saying. Saren

is attempting to bring back an

extinct race, with the help of the

geth, to exterminate all life in 

the galaxy? Impossible. 

SALARIAN COUNCILOR 
Where did the Reapers go? 

ASARI COUNCILOR 

Vanished. No trace of their very

existence. 


25. 

TURIAN COUNCILOR 
If they were real, we’d have foundsomething. 

SHEPARD 
We tried to warn you about Saren.
You’re making the same mistakeagain! 

ASARI COUNCILOR 
This is different. You proved Sarenbetrayed the council 

SALARIAN COUNCILOR 
And we now agree Saren is using thegeth to find the Conduit. 

TURIAN COUNCILOR 
What we don’t know is why. TheReapers are clearly just a myth. 

SALARIAN COUNCILOR 
A convenient lie to cover his true 
purpose. A legend he is using tobend the geth to his will. 

TURIAN COUNCILOR 
And your vision is still notadmissable evidence. 

SHEPARD 
50,000 years ago the Reapers wipedout galactic civilization. If Sarenfinds the Conduit, it will happenagain. 

TURIAN COUNCILOR 
Saren is a rogue agent, who willnow be on the run for his life 
without the resources of being aspectre. It’s a matter of timebefore he’s caught. 

UDINA 
We’re already out of time! 

ANDERSON 
The more we talk, the strongerposition Saren is in. Send in theCitadel fleet! 

TURIAN COUNCILOR 
Out of the question. We are notstarting a galactic war over this. 


26. 

SHEPARD 

Then allow me to go after him. Give

me the backing I need to bring him

in. 

TURIAN COUNCILOR 

No. It’s too soon. Humanity is not

ready for the responsibilities that

come with joining the spectres. 

SHEPARD 

It was a Turian spectre who

betrayed this council, and a human

who exposed him! 

The council goes into discussion. They reach a consensus andnod to Shepard. He takes a step forward. The councilors eachmake a note on the data pads in front of them. 

ASARI COUNCILOR 
Commander Shepard. 

Bystanders, most of them human, stop to look on. 

ASARI COUNCILOR (CONT’D)

It is the decision of the council 

that you be granted all the powers

and privileges of the Special

Tactics and Reconnaissance branch 

of the Citadel. 

SALARIAN COUNCILOR 

Spectres aren’t trained, but

chosen. Individuals forged in the

fire of service and battle. Those 

whose actions elevate them above 

the rank and file. 

ASARI COUNCILOR 

Spectres are an ideal. A symbol.

The embodiment of courage,

determination, and self reliance. 

They are the right hand of the

council. Instruments of our will. 

TURIAN COUNCILOR 

Spectres bear a great burden. They

are protectors of galactic peace.

Both our first, and last, line of 

defence. The safety of the galaxy

is theirs to uphold. 


27. 

ASARI COUNCILOR 
You are the first human spectre,
commander. This a greataccomplishment for you and yourentire species. 

SHEPARD 
I am honored, councilors. 

TURIAN COUNCILOR 
We are sending you after Saren. Youare authorized to use any meansnecessary to apprehend or eliminatehim. 

SHEPARD 
I won’t let you down. 

ASARI COUNCILOR 
The trial is adjourned. 

Shepard turns. Anderson gives him a hug. 

ANDERSON 
Congratulations, commander! 

UDINA 
There’s a lot of work to do 
Shepard. Best get to it. This isbut a small victory. I’ll beawaiting mission status reports. 

SHEPARD 
I’m going to need a ship. 

UDINA 
And a crew. 

Shepard looks back at Tali and Garrus. 

SHEPARD 
I’ve already found a worthy team. 

ANDERSON 
Then you can have my ship, and theoperational crew who comes with it. 

Shepard is shocked. 

SHEPARD 
Captain? The Normandy? 


28. 

ANDERSON 
This is your time Shepard. It’s oneof the best Alliance ships we have.
That, and, I’m sure the council 
doesn’t want me involved. 

SHEPARD 
I’m honored. 

ANDERSON 
And running out of time.

(beat)
Matriarch Benezia, I didn’t 
recognize her voice but I know whoshe is. She has a daughter, LiaraT'Soni. Specializes in prothean 
culture and technologies. I’ll findher location and forward it onto 
you. It’s as good a place to start 
as any. 

SHEPARD 
I won’t let you down. I won’t lethumanity down. 

ANDERSON 
Apprehend Saren. Stop the Geth.
Find the Conduit. And if the 
Reapers actually exist, God help usall. 

EXT. SPACE 

SOVEREIGN, a massive ship, the one seen on Eden Prime,
travels through space. Against the starry backdrop, only theoutline is seen. 

INT. SOVEREIGN 

Saren sits on a throne-like chair. Palm to face, he is 
slouched over and not happy. MATRIARCH BENEZIA, an olderasari, walks up to him. Saren doesn’t move. 

BENEZIA 
Reports say the Normandy has leftthe Citadel, but Anderson is no 
longer registered to it. 

SAREN 
Commander Shepard. 


29. 

Saren POUNDS the table in front of him. The ship lets out amechanical GRUMBLE. 

SAREN (CONT’D)
He used the beacon. He knows too 
much. 

BENEZIA 
He knows nothing. 

Shepard tosses the table aside, walks over to Benezia andgets in her face. Benezia is calm and not intimidated. 

SAREN 
This human... 

Saren calms down and takes a step back. 

SAREN (CONT’D)
Must be eliminated. 

Saren walks toward the exit. 

BENEZIA 
Finding the Conduit comes first. 

Saren stops but doesn’t turn. 

BENEZIA (CONT’D)
Shepard will perish, along with allthe humans. Do you questionSovereign? 

Saren turns his head in half acknowledgement. 

SAREN 
I do not question. But untilShepard is dealt with, he will beone more thorn in my side. 

BENEZIA 
Check on the facilities in Virmire. 
I will go to Noveria and see howthe rachni research is coming. 

SAREN 
Shepard’s a persistent one. He’llbe even more dangerous now thathe’s a spectre. I will go toVirmire and work with the other 
beacon. Increase the Noveria rachni 
tests. When Shepard comes looking,
we’ll be ready.

EXT. SPACE 

The Normandy exists a Mass Relay and heads toward the planetFEROS. It is covered with snow and storms. 

INT. NORMANDY, ENGINEERING 

A huge electrical orb is being contained by complexmachinery. Tali tinkers with the controls, making slightadjustments. 

INT. NORMANDY, GARAGE 

Wrex works on a MAKO, a six wheel armored personal carrier.
It has a cannon and machine gun turret on top. It is armoredlike a tank, but moves faster. 

Something breaks and he PUNCHES the door. A huge dent. 

INT. NORMANDY, ARMORY 

Garrus and Ashley argue over adjustments to the main batteryand targeting systems. 

INT. NORMANDY, COCKPIT 

Shepard joins Joker in the cockpit. Kaidan sits in thecopilot's chair. Shepard uses the intercom. 

SHEPARD 
Approaching Feros. Ashley, Garrus, 
prepare for ground drop. We don’tknow if Liara is working for Saren.
Joker, take us in slowly, let’s becareful. 

Shepard clicks the intercom off. 

JOKER 
Put the Normandy in my hands, I’llmake her dance... just don’t ask me 
to. Unless you like the sound ofsnapping shin bones. 

SHEPARD 
Right. Vrolik syndrome. Your bonesare too brittle for combat, so, 
how’d you land this gig anyway? 

Joker looks at Shepard, offended. 


31. 

JOKER 
I’m not good. I’m not even great.
I’m the best damn helmsman in the 
alliance fleet. Top of my class inflight school. I earned that. Theaccommodations in my file? I earnedthem too. You want me as yourpilot. 

SHEPARD 
Woah, now. 

JOKER 
Just sayin. 

EXT. FEROS - DAY 

The Normandy lands in front of a huge office building. A signdisplays the company, ExoGeni. Ashley, Garrus, and Shepard 
exit. 

GARRUS 
I don’t understand why it’s just 
us. 

SHEPARD 
You don’t bring an army intocorporate offices. 

INT. EXOGENI, LOBBY 

Shepard forces the door open. He walks inside. An emptybuilding. Shepard walks over to the front desk and does sometyping at the computer console. 

SHEPARD 
She’s in the lab at sub-level C. 

Shepard looks around. 

SHEPARD (CONT’D)
Elevators over there. 

Faint FOOTSTEPS. Shepard freezes. He motions with his hands.
A geth patrol. 

No sooner than they take cover do eight geth troopers appeararound a hallway corner. They walk right past Shepard andteam. One stops and notices the open door. Shepard motionsfor no movement, there will be no attack. 


32. 

The geth move on and continue down another hallway. Shepardmotions for them to follow him to the elevator. It DINGS when 
opening and breaks the tension. Ashley laughs. 

GARRUS 
That corporate army would be prettyhelpful right about now. 

They enter the elevators, Shepard gives them a glare. 

INT. EXOGENI, BASEMENT LAB 

A research laboratory. Computers stations and testing areas. 

Shepard’s team exit the elevators. They spot LIARA, an earlyadult asari, frozen in mid-air. Behind her is a huge room,
occupied by a menacing plant, the THORIAN. Two geth troopersguard her. They see Shepard and radio to other geth. 
Shepard’s team SHOOT and destroy them. 

SHEPARD 
Liara T’Soni? What happened here? 

LIARA 
Thank the Goddess! I did not think 
anybody would come looking for me.
I was doing research on the Thorian 
when the geth arrived. They tookeverybody! I don’t know what theydid with them. I’m the only oneleft. 

ASHLEY 
How do we know you aren’t workingwith them? 

Liara is confused. 

LIARA 
Does it look like I am? 

ASHLEY 
Your mother has been. Like mother 
like daughter. 

LIARA 
My mother? I haven’t spoken to herin years. 

The elevator DINGS. Floor numbers show it going up. 

SHEPARD 
Is there a back way out? 


33. 

LIARA 
We’d have to go through the Thorian 
lab. It’s not safe. 

Garrus walks up to a nearby console and shuts off the barrierfield keeping Liara in place. 

LIARA (CONT’D) 
Thank you. 

The elevator is coming back down. Liara runs to her computerand puts in a disk. 

SHEPARD 
What are you doing? 

LIARA 
Years of data. It’s too important! 

SHEPARD 
Not more than your life. Shepardrips the disk out. 

DING! The elevator doors open. Shepard and team draw theirweapons. They aim at the doors. Empty. 

ASHLEY 
I was... not expecting that. 

A SNAP. The elevator falls down the shaft. Geth troopers ropedown the elevator shaft into the room. 

GARRUS 
I choose the plant. 

SHEPARD 
Agreed. 

LIARA 
This way! 

Liara runs to the back of the room. She types in a passcodeand a sealed door opens into the huge room containing theThorian. 

INT. EXOGENI, THORIAN CHAMBER 

The Thorian is massive. A three story tall menacing plant.
Catwalks circle the room, around the plant. A glass ceilinglet’s in light from above. The door closes behind the team. 


34. 

LIARA 
Up the catwalks! There’s an exit atground level. 

The team runs up the catwalks. 

ASHLEY 
Care to explain why the geth locked 
you up? 

The lab door is blown open. Dozens of geth enter. Bullets 
wildly shoot everywhere. 

SHEPARD 
Better talk fast. 

LIARA 
The Thorian is an indigenouslifeform here. ExoGeni build this 
facility on Feros specifically tostudy it. 

More bullets. They hit the Thorian. A large GROAN. The 
Thorian’s branches and vines begin to move. Slow at first.
Then, SNAP. It whips one of the geth. It smashes against the 
wall and crumbles to the floor. Spores spout out from thetips of it’s vines. Alarms trigger. Lights flash. 

PA SYSTEM (V.O.)
Please discharge all weapons whilein research lab alpha. Do notdisrupt Species 37. I repeat... 

The team continues, one-third of the way up the catwalks. 

GARRUS 
It’s attacking? 

LIARA 
More than that. It releases those 
spores and when inhaled allow it tocontrol other organisms. 

SHEPARD 
Mind control? 

LIARA 
Something like that, yes. 

ASHLEY 
You were studying this... thing?
How do we know you’re not affected? 


35. 

LIARA 
You wouldn’t know. But I’m not. I’m 
very careful. 

A Thorian vine SMASHES the catwalk in front of them. There’s 
a large gap. Shepard motions to jump. Ashley goes first. 

LIARA (CONT’D) 
The geth arrived a few days ago. 

Garrus jumps over. The vine aggressively moves toward theteam. Shepard fires. 

LIARA (CONT’D)
A turian arrived with them, someone 
named Saren, demanding I give himthe cipher. He was also interestedin the Thorian’s telepathicabilities. 

SHEPARD 
Saren? 

Liara jumps across. Shepard follows. They continue up thecatwalk. 

LIARA 
Yes. And Sovereign. I think thatwas his ship, but he spoke as if hewas here on it’s behalf. Saren 
spoke of indoctrination. Of bendingorganics to his will. And rachni. 

More gun shots. The geth are closing the gap. Two-thirds upthe catwalk. 

ASHLEY 
And we’re supposed to believeyou’re on our side? 

LIARA 
I refused to cooperate with them.
Saren left and the geth put me inthat barrier field until you came 
to rescue me. 

The Thorian is getting more violent. 

JOKER 

(over radio)
Joker to ground team, need an eta.
We’ve got company. 


36. 

Shepard looks back at the geth. They are close. The Thorian 
grabs one and flings it toward the team. They duck as itcrashes against the wall. 

SHEPARD 
I think we found them. 

JOKER 

(over radio)

When was the last time you looked

outside? 

Shepard looks up and out the ceiling window. A GETH WARSHIPpasses overhead. Shepard looks toward the exit. Almost there. 

SHEPARD 
Hold on, Joker! Ready for pick-upin 30 seconds! 

The exit is in reach with geth right behind them now. Garrusblasts open the exit door. A vine trips Shepard. Liara turnsaround and summands a ball of blue energy. She shoots it atthe geth. They go flying in all directions. She summons 
another and fires it at the lab below. She is tired and out 
of breath after. Shepard gets up. 

GARRUS 
Holding out on us? 

LIARA 
The lab is full of unstable 
elements. We don’t have much time. 

SHEPARD 
Let’s get out of here. 

More geth continue up the catwalk. 

EXT. FEROS 

The team exits and board the Normandy. 

Geth exit the lab and fire at the Normandy as it takes off. Ahuge explosion blows up the facility. 

The Normandy is just out of blast range. The geth warshipfutility fires at them. They escape. 

EXT. SPACE 

The Normandy leaves Feros’s atmosphere. 


37. 

INT. NORMANDY CONFERANCE ROOM - LATER 

Shepard, Ashley, Kaidan, Wrex, Garrus, Tali, and Liara sit ina circular formation. 

WREX 
I would have joined you had I knownthere’d be geth! 

Wrex pounds his fists together. 

SHEPARD 
Had I known that I would have 
waited for back-up. 

GARRUS 
Liara, back on the catwalks youmentioned Saren spoke of rachni? 
And a cipher? 

KAIDAN 
The rachni have been extinct for 
centuries. 

WREX 
Yeah. Thanks to krogan! You’re 
welcome. No more space bugs. 

KAIDAN 
Why would Saren have interest inanother extinct race? 

Shepard hits the intercom. 

JOKER 

(sarcastic)
Commander! Nice work back there. 
Ten more seconds and we would have 
been swimming in fire. The Normandyisn’t equipped to land in explodingbuildings. It tends to fry our 
sensors and melt our hull! ...Just 
for future reference. 

SHEPARD 
Joker, call alliance command. Let 
me know if they’ve heard anyreports of rachni. 

JOKER 
Right. That makes sense too. WhileI’m at it I’ll check how the search 
for the boogey-man is coming. Cannever be too careful. 


38. 

SHEPARD 
Thanks. 

Shepard closes the link. 

SHEPARD (CONT’D)
What else did you mention? The...
cipher? 

LIARA 
History. Culture. The veryexistence of a past civilization. 

The room is confused. 

LIARA (CONT’D) 
The Thorian was ancient. It watched 
and studied the protheans of old, 
just as it did now with humans. Thecipher is the very essence of beinga prothean. Endemic ancestralmemory. A viewpoint spanningthousands of prothean generations. 

ASHLEY 
Now how about in a way that makessense? 

LIARA 
I melded with the Thorian. Our 
identities merged, mindsintertwined. I gained the cipher ofwhat it is to be prothean. This iswhat Saren wanted. 

Ashley stands up. She walks over to Liara and gets right inher face 

ASHLEY 
I thought you said you didn’tcooperate with him? 

LIARA 
It was that, or death. I 
transferred the cipher to him. Butit is useless without reference. 

SHEPARD 
The prothean vision from thebeacon! He’ll use the cipher todecode the vision and find the 
Conduit. 


39. 

ASHLEY 
Great. 

KAIDAN 
So Saren can understand protheannow? 

TALI 
And so, Saren stays one step aheadof us. 

SHEPARD 
Liara. Give me the cipher. Iexperienced the same vision. 

ASHLEY 
Don’t do it commander. I don’t 
trust her. 

SHEPARD 
I’ll make that call. 

Ashley is put off by the commander’s choice. 

LIARA 
You? Had the same vision? 

SHEPARD 
Yes. The same beacon. 

Shepard walks to the center of the group. Liara gets up andhas to nudge her way past Ashley. 

LIARA 
When I transfer you the cipher, fora moment, we will be as one. 

SHEPARD 
I’m ready. 

ASHLEY 
Wait. How come you didn’t seeSaren’s vision? 

LIARA 
He blocked it from me. Shepard hasto be willing to open his mind andlet me in. 

Ashley takes a step forward. 

ASHLEY 
Be careful, skipper. 


40. 

LIARA 
The vision you had must be unclear,
confusing without the cipher. Itwas meant for a prothean mind. 

Liara puts her hands on each side of Shepard’s head. 

LIARA (CONT’D)
Such knowledge cannot be taught. Itsimply exists. Relax. Embraceeternity. 

Shepard and Liara lock eyes. There are pulses of energytransferred between them. The crew watches in awe. Ashleydoesn’t want to look. 

The images in Shepard’s head are not scrambled anymore. Liaraand Shepard witness it together. The transfer ends with afinal burst of energy. 

Liara stumbles back into her chair. Shepard takes a few stepsback. Ashley rushes over to the commander. Tali and Kaidancheck on Liara. 

ASHLEY 
Are you alright? What’d she do to 
you? 

SHEPARD 
I saw... something. It’s more clearnow, but... 

LIARA 
That was incredible. All this time, 
I never dreamed... I’m sorry. Theimages were so vivid. That was...
intense. I’m surprised, Shepard.
The beacon, the cipher, what you’vebeen through would have destroyed alesser mind. 

ASHLEY 
Yeah. Right. What did you see? 

LIARA 
The beacon on Eden Prime must have 
been badly damaged. Large parts ofthe vision are missing. 

ASHLEY 
You’re the prothean expert. Anyclues? The location of the Conduit? 


41. 

LIARA 
It’s a warning. It confirmed whatyou suspected about the Reapers.
The protheans were wiped out by arace of sentient machines. It 
explains why there’s remarkablylittle archeological evidence ofthe fall of the protheans. As if 
someone didn’t want the mysterysolved. 

TALI 
So, these reapers. They exterminatethe protheans. Then scour the 
galaxy erasing the evidence. Why? 

LIARA 
According to my findings, theprotheans were not the first 
galactic civilization tomysteriously vanish. This cyclebegan long before them. 

ASHLEY 
Then how come I’ve never heard that 
before? 

LIARA 
I’ve been researching this forfifty years. I’ve tracked downevery scrap of evidence I can find.
Eventually, subtle patterns startto emerge. They hint at the truth.
I cannot point to one specificthing to prove my case, it’s more afeeling from a half century ofresearch. But, feelings do notreceive scientific publish. 

GARRUS 
Then thy would Saren partner withreapers? 

LIARA 
It... doesn’t make sense. Each time 
a great civilization rises up, itis suddenly and violently castdown. Only ruins survive. I canonly imagine they’ve offered Sarensomething in return. 

KAIDAN 
Which is great, but that doesn’thelp us find the Conduit.

(MORE) 


42. 

KAIDAN (CONT'D) 
Without that, the Reapers willstill return. 

There is BUZZ from the intercom. 

JOKER 
Commander, I found your boogey-man. 

EXT. SPACE 

The Normandy flies into a Mass Relay and shoots off into the 
stars. 

EXT. EDOLUS - DAY 

The Normandy heads toward the planet Edolus. It is a dust 
covered world, with vast deserts. 

EXT. EDOLUS UPPER ATMOSPHERE 

Dust storms ROCK the Normandy. 

JOKER 

(on radio)
Commander, it’s not worth the risk 
landing here. You’re going to haveto take the mako. 

The back of the Normandy opens up, revealing the mako. 

SHEPARD 
We’re in, and ready. 

JOKER 
(on radio)
Deploying now. 

The mako exits the Normandy. 

EXT. EDOLUS 

The mako falls to the planet surface. Propulsion jets softenthe landing. They are below the storms and it is more clear. 

INT. MAKO 

Kaidan drives. Tali sits next to him. Shepard and Wrex sit inthe back. 


43. 

TALI 
500 meters to crash site. No signof rachni yet. 

WREX 
Something feels off.
(beat)
I like it. 

SHEPARD 
I need everyone on full alert.
Remember the reason why we’re here.
The last alliance team went off the 
grid as soon as they touched down. 

TALI 
100 meters. I’m getting a clearsignal from the site. A distresscall. 

The team look out the front of the mako. A lone tower, 10 
feet high, is surrounded by debris. A few Alliance soldierssuits lay among the debris. Looking farther around the areaare large collapsed holes in the ground. The mako slows to a 
stop. 

WREX 
Well, this is our stop. 

EXT. DEBRIS SITE 

Shepard and Wrex exit the mako. Wrex examines the debriscloser. Shepard walks up to the tower. 

SHEPARD 
It doesn’t make any sense. 

WREX 
Seems obvious to me. Your alliance 
friends crashed here. Probablyattacked by rachni, then they 
contacted alliance command. 

SHEPARD 
No. They wouldn’t have set-up thissignal. It’s too perfect. 

The ground RUMBLES. Wrex draws his shotgun. 

SHEPARD (CONT’D)
We’ve been set-up. 


44. 

WREX 
About time. I was getting bored. 

Wrex anxiously looks around. The RUMBLE grows. 

A THRESHER MAW shoots out of ground next to the mako. Thethresher maw is 100 feet high, it’s body like a centipede.
It’s head has a huge mouth with two mandibles on the side. 

The mako flips over from the impact. The Thresher Maw spitsacid at the mako, SPARKS. Wrex and Shepard look at each otherand run different directions. Shepard radios to the mako. 

SHEPARD 
Kaidan, how long until you’re backonline? 

INT. MAKO 

Tali is in the back of the flipped mako. Wires hang, sparksfly, and lights flash. 

KAIDAN 
Not soon enough. You’ll need to becreative. 

EXT. DEBRIS SITE 

The Thresher Max spits acid toward Shepard. He dodges it justin time. 

SHEPARD 
(into radio)
So will you! 

INT. MAKO 

Tali rips out some wires and connects others. 

TALI 
Reroute the shields to the 
propulsion system. Shut downemergency systems and fully powerthe plasma cannon. We’ll have oneshot. 

Tali joins Kaidan up front and sits in the copilot chair.
Kadian is flipping switches and pressing buttons. Kaidan isabout to hit the final button when Tali grabs his hand. 


45. 

TALI (CONT’D) 
One shot. 

EXT. DEBRIS SITE 

The thresher maw nears Shepard. Wrex throws a grenade as highas he can. It explodes next to the thresher maw’s head. Itbecomes disoriented. It dives back into the ground. 

RUMBLING. Shepard and Wrex run back toward the mako, a halfmile away. Behind them the thresher maw bursts back out ofthe ground in pursuit. It’s massive body lunges in and out ofthe ground after them. 

Wrex fires back while running. It’s bullets hardly distractit. Shepard looks at the mako. 

SHEPARD 
(to self)
What are they waiting on? 

INT. MAKO 

TALI 
Hold... 

KAIDAN 
We’re out of time! 

Kaidan goes to press the button but is blocked by Tali again. 

EXT. DEBRIS SITE 

The Thresher Maw is in reach of Shepard and Wrex. The mako isclose, but they won’t make it. The thresher maw prepares it’sfinal lunge. 

INT. MAKO 

TALI 
NOW! 

Kaidan punches the button. 

EXT. DEBRIS SITE 

The mako’s propulsion system fire-up. The mako flips itselfback over. The mako’s plasma cannon locks onto the ThresherMaw. 


46. 

INT. MAKO 

Tali aims at her target. She fires. 

EXT. DEBRIS SITE 

The Thresher Maw is coming down on Shepard and Wrex. Wrexblasts the Thresher Maw once more with his shotgun. ItEXPLODES in a mess of goo. Shepard and Wrex look at his gunconfused. 

SHEPARD 
(to Wrex)
Nice shot. 

TALI 
You’re welcome! 

Wrex and Shepard turn. Tali stands next to the mako. Smokeleaves the mako’s cannon. 

EXT. EDOLUS MOUNTAINS - LATER 

The mako heads toward a mountain range, it’s barely drivable.
In the far background they leave the debris site behind. 

INT. MAKO 

KAIDAN 
Are you sure this is the rightdirection? 

TALI 
Positive. It’s a faint signal, butthere’s definitely someone elsehere. 

EXT. EDOLUS MOUNTAINS 

The mako clears a mountain ridge and reveals a set of doorsbuilt into the side of a mountain. 

The mako stops. The entire team gets out. 

SHEPARD 
Now we find out what’s really goingon here. 

Shepard leads the team up to the doors. There’s no visibleway to open them. 


47. 

WREX 
Excuse me. 

Shepard steps aside. Wrex steps back. 

SHEPARD 
So, you going to open it, or...? 

Wrex laughs. He charges at the door. SMASH. The team looks atthe door, dented by still standing. Wrex gives it blow. Itfalls down. Wrex smiles. 

WREX 
After you. 

INT. CERBERUS LAB, ENTRANCE 

The team enters. A pristine white staircase leads down intothe mountain. There’s a CERBERUS SYMBOL on the wall. The team 
sees a security camera looking at them. 

KAIDAN 
If the door didn’t give it away,
they definitely know we’re here 
now. 

TALI 
Who are these people? 

Shepard looks at the symbol with destain. 

SHEPARD 
Cerberus. 

The team draws their weapons and head down the stairs. 

INT. CERBERUS LAB 

The team reach the bottom of the stairs. A research lab 
stretches deep into the mountain. Scientists in lab coatsnotice the team but keep working. 

SHEPARD 
I don’t get it. 

Tali studies their actions. 

TALI 
They’re erasing the data! 


48. 

Shepard runs into the lab trying to stop the scientists.
Kaidan and Tali follow. There’s too many. Wrex shoots hisshotgun. Silence. 

WREX 
So, about that thresher maw back 
there. Who wants to explain it. 

Nobody speaks. Wrex shoots a computer. 

WREX (CONT’D)
Please, continue to test mypatience. 

The LEAD SCIENTIST walks forward as if on death row. 

LEAD SCIENTIST 
(sighs)
I’m in charge. 

Wrex nods to Shepard. 

SHEPARD 
We’re looking for rachni. And 
answers. 

INT. CERBERUS LAB, HOLDING CELLS 

The scientist leads the team into the holding cells area. 

LEAD SCIENTIST 
It’s actually quite fascinating.
The chance to test on a race 
thought to be extinct? Priceless! 

They walk by cells titled THORIAN CREEPERS. Inside are what 
looks to be walking mummified humans. 

SHEPARD 
You were testing on humans! It’s 
not fascinating. It’s disgusting. 

More cells, titled THRESHER MAW. Inside the different cells 
are eggs and baby thresher maw. 

LEAD SCIENTIST 
Possibly. But it’s what I’m paidfor. You don’t have to like our 
means, but Cerberus always get what 
we want. 


49. 

TALI 
You’re a radical human terrorist 
group! 

LEAD SCIENTIST 
Please. We promote human expansionin the galaxy. To secure ourselvesa rightful and permanent spot amongthe races of the universe. Self-
serving? Maybe. Terrorist? I don’tthink so. 

TALI 
Then why test on your own kind? 

LEAD SCIENTIST 
Like I said. By any meansnecessary... we get the results weneed. 

They stop in front of cells labeled RACHNI. Space bugs. Theirtop half looks similar to shrimp, supported by four legsunderneath it. 

LEAD SCIENTIST (CONT’D)
And in this case, it meant luringAlliance soldiers into a trap. Wehad to see what the rachni were 
capable of in a fight. 

SHEPARD 
And the thresher maw? 

LEAD SCIENTIST 
The facility has been around longbefore we got our hands on rachni. 
That’s only the latest round oftesting. 

SHEPARD 
Where’d you get the rachni from. 

LEAD SCIENTIST 
I can’t tell you that. 

Wrex pulls out his shotgun and shoot one of the rachni. It 
explodes into pieces. 

LEAD SCIENTIST (CONT’D)
No! You can’t-

Wrex aims the gun at the scientist. 


50. 

LEAD SCIENTIST (CONT’D)
Right. Okay. I might be able to 
help you out.

(beat)
I got them from Noveria. 

WREX 
Go on. 

LEAD SCIENTIST 
Cerberus has contacts all over. 
We... borrowed them. An asari 
matriarch was trying to clone themor something. I can give you theirfacility’s location. Just,

(beat)
Let me live. 

EXT. EDOLUS MOUNTAINS - LATER 

The sun shines. The dust storms are gone. 

The scientists stand outside the facility. The mako drivesaboard the Normandy and they take off. As they leave anexplosion is heard from within the mountain. Fire erupts outthe entrance doors. 

LEAD SCIENTIST 
Someone call the Illusive Man. 

EXT. NOVERIA - DAY 

A frozen rocky world. Covered in snow. The Normandy fliestoward the surface 

NOVERIA CONTROL (O.S.)
We are not expecting any arrivalstoday. Please identify. We have youtargeted and are prepared to fire. 

EXT. NOVERIA PORT 

The Normandy hovers outside the docking area. 

JOKER (O.S.)

Welcome Normandy. We will bechecking identification uponlanding, or risk being impounded. 

The Normandy docks. 

INT. NOVERIA PORT - LATER 

Shepard exits the Normandy with Liara and Ashley. Waiting forthem are two PORT WORKERS and PORT CHIEF PARASINI, a 
confident women in her mid-30’s. 

PORT CHIEF PARASINI 
Just the Spectre. Nobody elseleaves the dock. 

SHEPARD 
We all go. 

PORT CHIEF PARASINI 
This is an unscheduled arrival. I 
need your credentials. 

SHEPARD 
You first. 

PORT WORKER 
Excuse me? We’re the law here. 

Parasini gives a silent ‘stand down’ look to the worker. 

PORT CHIEF PARASINI 
Gianna Parasini, Risk Management.
You’re a long way from the Citadel, 
spectre. 

ASHLEY 
You’re a short way from a gun inyour face. 

PORT CHIEF PARASINI 
I also must remind you no weaponsare allowed on Noveria. 

SHEPARD 
Spectre status overrules Noverialaw. We have urgent business here.
We’re heard reports of rachni. 


52. 

PORT CHIEF PARASINI 

Yes... the rachni. You being here 

is troubling, but the reports I’ve

heard of rachni are worse. 

ASHLEY 
So it’s true. 

PORT CHIEF PARASINI 

I don’t know. Lady Benezia keeps to

herself, but, I’ve heard rumors of 

what goes on in her labs. 

LIARA 
Benezia? She... is here? 

PORT CHIEF PARASINI 

She hasn’t done anything wrong,

yet. I’m not allowed to arrest her

for being suspicious. 

SHEPARD 

She’s a threat to galactic peace.

I’m here to bring her in, or, 

Shepard looks over at Liara. 

SHEPARD (CONT’D)

We’re here to bring her in. Council

orders. 

PORT CHIEF PARASINI 

Take the tram to Peak 15. Only the

three of you. My superiors aren’t

happy that we allowed you to land

to begin with. Here, 

Parasini gives Shepard a keycard. 

PORT CHIEF PARASINI (CONT’D)

Unlimited access to the Peak 15 

facility. For 3 hours. Do what you

need to do, and get out of Noveria. 

EXT. NOVERIA TRAM - DAY 

A tram car leaves the Noveria port. It heads toward a largebuilding near the top of a hill. Even from far away, a large“15” is painted on the front of the building. 


53. 

EXT. PEAK 15 

The tram enters Peak 15. Door seal them inside. 

INT. PEAK 15, DOCK 

The team exits the tram. Cement walls. The few windows on the 
ceiling are cracked. Snow covers the ground. Metal CREAKSfrom the interior of the facility. There’s a single door. 

ASHLEY 
This place is in great shape. 

Shepard tries the door. It doesn’t open. Scans keycard. The 
door opens. 

INT. PEAK 15, MESS HALL - CONTINUOUS 

The team enter a mess hall. A few humans eat scraps. Otherssleep. One is being tended by a doctor. An OFFICER runs up toShepard. 

OFFICER 
By God! I thought nobody would evercome! We’ve been locked in for 
days! 

SHEPARD 
What’s the situation. 

OFFICER 
Bugs. Zillions of them. Theyoverran the hot labs last week. 
We’re not military! We were nevertrained for this! 

Ashley checks her ammo. 

SHEPARD 
We’ll look into it. 

OFFICER 

(panicked)
The mess hall isn’t safe. It was 
supposed to temporary. We havesearch teams. They go to otherfloors looking for food orsurvivors. Most don’t come back. 
There’s another group of us in thegym, and the library. Benezia won’tlet us leave! 


54. 

LIARA 
I refuse to believe my mother hasanything to do with this. 

FOOTSTEPS. Something crawls from above the ceiling. The messhall goes silent. Guns and eyes focus on the footsteps.
There’s a SCREECHING sound. The footsteps continue, and soontrail off. Shepard shows the officer his keycard. 

SHEPARD 
Tell me where Matriarch Benezia 
is. I find her, and we all leave. 
Alive. 

The officer points toward one of the room’s exits. 

OFFICER 
End of that hallway. Straightahead. Past the hot labs. In the 
main research chamber. 

Shepard motions for the team to head out. 

INT. PEAK 15, HALLWAY 

The team heads down the hallway. A SCREECH in the distance.
FOOTSTEPS above the ceiling and along the wall. 

ASHLEY 
I hate aliens. 

LIARA 
Beg your pardon? 

ASHLEY 
A rogue turian spectre. Gethattacks. Thresher maws. Now rachni. 

Ashley looks at Liara. 

ASHLEY (CONT’D)
Even a backstabbing AsariMatriarch. 

LIARA 
I’m not like her! 

ASHLEY 
I’m still not sold on which side 
you’re on. 


55. 

LIARA 
I’m on nobody’s side! What aboutthe Cerberus scientists? 

Ashley has no answer. 

LIARA (CONT’D)
No species is perfect. Not mine.
Not yours-

SHEPARD 
Alright, that’s enough. Keep yourfocus on the mission. 

A rachni bursts out from a hallway door. Shepard and Ashleyshoot. The rachni explodes. 

They continue. Glass windows allow them to see into a lab.
Darkness and shadows. The ground moves. 

SHEPARD (CONT’D) 
Run! 

The team run down the hallway. Rachni crash through thewindow behind them. They fall through the ceiling ahead ofthem, and behind them. There’s at least a dozen. 

Shepard and Ashley fire at them, killing a few. They arebeing overwhelmed. Liara summons a ball of energy and shootsit behind them. The ball travels a few feet and stops. Itstarts swirling and pulls the Rachni toward it. The teamreach the end of the hallway. 

INT. NOVERIA, RESEARCH CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS 

The team enter the main research chamber. A square room.
Walls covered with screens. Work stations all over. Elevated 
in the center of the room is huge glass capsule. Inside isthe RACHNI QUEEN. She is gigantic, but scared. 

Matriarch Benezia stands in front of the capsule at the mainwork station. Two ASARI BODYGUARDS stand next to her, 
watching Shepard’s team. Benezia finishes some lastcalculations and turns. Liara’s mouth drops. 

LIARA 
No. 

BENEZIA 
You do not know the privilege ofbeing a mother. There is power increation. 


56. 

Benezia turns to the Rachni Queen. She marvels at it. 

BENEZIA (CONT’D)
To shape a life, turn it towardshappiness or despair.

(beat)
Her children were to be ours. To 
hunt and slay Saren’s enemies. 

Benezia turns to Shepard. 

BENEZIA (CONT’D)
I won’t be moved by sympathy. Nomatter who you bring here. 

SHEPARD 
Liara’s here because she wants to 
be. Not because I asked her to. 

BENEZIA 
And what have you told him aboutme, Liara? 

LIARA 
What could I say, mother? Thatyou’re lost? Insane? Evil? Whatcould I say? 

BENEZIA 
You could have warned him to stayout of my way! 

Benezia summons energy, a blue essence surrounds her. Shepoints at Shepard, freezing him in place. Her bodyguards runtoward them. 

Liara summons up a ball of energy and fires it at one of theguards. The guard is thrown backward and knocked unconscious. 

Benezia tosses Shepard aside. Shepard unfreezes but is hurt.
Ashley finds cover and takes aim at the second bodyguard.
Liara charges toward Benezia. 

BENEZIA (CONT’D)
Saren is unstoppable! 

Benezia unleashes a ball of energy larger than anything Liarahas summoned. Liara dives out of the way. 

Ashley is pinned down by the bodyguard. She is joined byShepard. 


57. 

BENEZIA (CONT’D)
My mind is filled with his light!
Everything is... clear! 

Benezia struggles to shoot another energy ball at Liara. Thistime Liara deflects it. Liara grows tired. 

BENEZIA (CONT’D)
I will not betray him. I will not.. 

There is an internal struggle within Benezia. She tries torestrain herself. She reluctantly fires another ball atLiara. It hits. Liara goes flying ten feet back. 

The second body guard is distracted by Liara’s hit. Ashleyshoots the body guard. She drops dead. Shepard and Ashley runto Liara’s side. Benezia freezes Shepard and Ashley in place 

BENEZIA (CONT’D)
You will... You must... listen. 

Benezia again struggles, trying to release Shepard andAshley. 

BENEZIA (CONT’D)
Saren whispers in my mind. I canfight his compulsions briefly, but,
the indoctrination is strong. 

Liara struggles to stand. 

LIARA 
Saren isn’t here. You have yourselfto blame! 

BENEZIA 
People aren’t themselves aroundSaren. You come to idolize him, 
worship him. You would do anythingfor him! 

Benezia tightens control of her freeze on Ashley and Shepard.
In her other hand she starts to summon a ball of energy. 

BENEZIA (CONT’D)
The key is Sovereign. Saren’sflagship. A huge dreadnought ofincredible size and extraordinary 
power. 

Liara limps toward Benezia. 


58. 

BENEZIA (CONT’D)

Thoughts echo strangely within

Sovereign. Indoctrination. The

longer you stay on board, the more

Saren’s will seems correct. You sit 

at his feet and smile as his words 

pour into you. 

Benezia aims her energy ball at Liara. 

BENEZIA (CONT’D)

Saren thought we could use the

rachni as tools. Make an army. I

thought I was strong enough to

resist. Instead I became a willing

tool, eager to serve. 

LIARA 
You don’t have to do this. 

She exhales deeply and shakes off an invisible force. Beneziaunfreezes Shepard and Ashley. They walk toward Benezia. 

BENEZIA 

Saren sent me here to find the 

location of the Mu Mass Relay. It’s

position was lost thousands of

years ago in rachni controlled 

space. The rachni share memories 

across generations. Queens inherit

the knowledge of their mothers. I

took the location of the Mu Relay

from the queen’s mind.

(sorrowful)
I was not gentle. 

SHEPARD 
We need that data to stop Saren. 

Benezia hands over a disk. 

BENEZIA 
Take it. Please. 

ASHLEY 

Knowing the Mu Relay’s coordinates

is not enough. We need to know

where Saren plans to go after

passing through it. 

BENEZIA 

He wouldn’t tell me his end 

destination. But, I do know where 

he is now. Virmire. 

(MORE) 


59. 

BENEZIA (CONT'D) 
You must leave quickly. I’vealready told him the location ofthe Mu Relay. 

Benezia is losing control. Her voice strains. She begins tocry light tears. 

BENEZIA (CONT’D)
You have to stop... me. I can’t.
His teeth are at my ear. Fingers onmy spine. You should, you need to-

LIARA 
Mother! Don’t leave! Fight him! 

Benezia gives Liara a look of approval. 

BENEZIA 
You’ve always made me proud, Liara. 

Benezia bows her head. Liara watches, hoping. Benezia’s headrises back up and blue energy again surrounds her. She shootsan energy blast at Liara. It’s deflected. Benezia shootsanother. Liara absorbs the blast. Benezia summons her 
remaining amount of energy. She shoots. Liara shoots back.
The energy balls collide, blasting Benezia to the ground.
Liara is worn out but walks up to Benezia, stands above her,
and summons an energy ball. They lock eyes. Benezia strugglesto speak. 

BENEZIA (CONT’D)
Goodnight, little wing. 

Liara’s energy ball vanishes. She crouches down to Benezia’sside. 

LIARA 
Mother! 

Benezia stares off. 

BENEZIA 
No light? They always said there’d 
be... 

Benezia’s eyes close. Her body goes limp. Shepard and Ashleyjoin Liara. 

SHEPARD 
I’m sorry. 

Liara takes a moment, but then stands with confidence. 


60. 

LIARA 
It had to be done. Just one more 
reason to find the Conduit and stopSaren. 

(beat)
I would like to leave here now. 

Liara takes a step and freezes. 

SHEPARD 
Liara? 

Shepard shakes Liara. Liara hovers a couple feet off thefloor. Her pupils glow. 

LIARA 
Do not. Leave. 

It is not Liara’s voice. Liara, still hovering, drifts infront of the large Rachni Queen chamber. 

RACHI QUEEN (THROUGH LIARA)
This one. Serves. As our voice. 

Shepard and Ashley draw their weapons. The Rachni Queenscreeches from within the tube. 

RACHNI QUEEEN 
This vessel. Is at the edge. Wecannot sing. Not in these lowspaces. Your musics are colorless. 

SHEPARD 
Let her go or we’ll fill you withenough plasma to pop a turian tank. 

RACHNI QUEEEN 
We are the mother. We sing. Forthose left behind. The children youthought silenced. We. Are rachni. 

SHEPARD 
Did you order your children to killthe people out there? 

Shepard motions to the room entrance. 

RACHNI QUEEEN 
No. We were. Locked away here. Thechildren are beyond our songs. Theyhave been lost. To silence. You. 
Are not in harmony with those whohoped to control us.

(MORE) 


61. 

RACHNI QUEEEN (CONT'D) 
What will you sing? Will yourelease us? Are we to fade awayonce more? 

ASHLEY 
Commander, I don’t trust this 
thing, we know it’s kind arekillers. That chamber has a 
emergency toxin release. Irecommend using it. 

RACHNI QUEEEN 
You have the power to free us, orreturn us to the silence of memory. 

Ashley shakes her head no to Shepard. 

RACHNI QUEEEN (CONT’D)
Give us. A chance to compose anew.
We will remember. We will sing ofyour forgiveness to our children. 

The Rachni Queen relinquishes control of Liara. Liara islowered to the ground and her pupils go back to normal. 

SHEPARD 
Liara! Are you ok? 

LIARA 
Yes. I’m... fine, I’m alright. I’mmore concerned about-

Liara nods to the rachni queen. 

LIARA (CONT'D) 
Her. 

ASHLEY 
There’s a reason they were huntedto extinction. We can’t just cutthem loose. 

LIARA 
The council exterminated them once 
before. An entire race. Gone. She 
hasn’t done nothing to us. This isour chance to atone. 

Shepard walks over to a console nearby. A green buttonpictures doors opening. A red button pictures gas with askull and bones. The Rachni Queen looks back at Shepard. ItSHRIEKS. 


62. 

SHEPARD 
I won’t destroy your entire race.
(beat)
You’ll go free. 

Shepard hits the green button. The team watches as thechamber lifts up. Ceiling doors slide open, and the chamberreleases the Rachni Queen. It scampers off with a SCREECH. 

SHEPARD (CONT’D)
I think we’ve all had enough here.
Liara, notify the Normandy to prepfor leave. Ashley, give theAlliance a head’s up. We’re going 
to Virmire. 

EXT. VIRMIRE 

From space Virmire is filled with oceans and greencontinents. 

EXT. VIRMIRE, SAREN’S BASE - SUNRISE 

A huge facility is built on top of a high cliff. Surroundingit is lush tropical jungle. 

INT. SAREN’S BASE, CONTROL ROOM 

Saren calmly stares out a window. The sun rises. Gethinterface with computers behind him. 

A GETH SOLDIER enters. Two more geth enter, holding asalarian solider. 

GETH SOLDIER 
Saren Commander. 

Saren continues to stare out the window. 

SAREN 
Yes? 

GETH COMMANDER 
We found another Salarian scout. 

SAREN 
Kill him. It means nothing. 

GETH COMMANDER 
No interrogation, this time? 


63. 

Saren turns around. 

SAREN 
I said, kill him. 

Geth Commander motions to the others. They drag thestruggling Salarian away. 

GETH COMMANDER 
Saren Commander, that is the third 
scout. The Salarian infiltrator 
unit nearby will be prepping anattack. 

SAREN 
Let them. They cannot stop us. Notwith an army of krogan. Not with an 
legion of rachni. Not with theReapers soon arrival. 

Geth Commander is reluctant to respond. 

SAREN (CONT’D)
Is there a problem? 

GETH COMMANDER 
The Rachni Queen escaped. Beneziais... dead. 

Saren remains calm. 

SAREN 
Who is responsible for this? 

GETH COMMANDER 
Spectre Shepard. 

Saren turns around. 

SAREN 
A setback. Sovereign won’t bepleased. 

Saren waves off the Geth Commander. 

SAREN (CONT’D)
Go. And increase Krogan production 
twenty percent. 

Saren turns back to the window. He dislodges his gun andwhips it at the nearest geth. 


64. 

EXT. VIRMIRE - DAY 

The Normandy flies over the jungles of Virmire. 

EXT. VIRMIRE, SALARIAN CAMP 

The Normandy slows down and lands in front of a hastily puttogether salarian base camp. 

Shepard’s team exits the Normandy. Salarian CAPTAIN KIRRAHEgreets them. 

CAPTAIN KIRRAHE 
Greetings Shepard! I am CaptainKirrahe. 3rd Infiltration RegimentSTG. Heard Matriarch Benezia died. 
Unfortunate. At least you foundSaren. The Council sent us and 
mentioned reinforcements. Where are 
the reinforcements? 

Kirrahe looks around. He searches for other ships. 

KAIDAN 
We are. 

CAPTAIN KIRRAHE 
What? Just us? You? We’ll need 
more. Much more. We’ve been 
scouting ever since we landed. 

Shepard starts walking toward the base camp. Kirrahe follows. 

SHEPARD 
The Council sent what they couldspare. They aren’t willing to risk 
a war. 

CAPTAIN KIRRAHE 
I’ve already lost five men. Yourteam just replaces them. Thisfacility is crawling with geth, and 
well fortified. 

The team walks by a group of Salarian soldiers eating. 

TALI 
What else do you know? 

CAPTAIN KIRRAHE 
Non-military. Seems to be aresearch facility. 


65. 

INT. VIRMIRE, SALARIAN CAMP CONTROL 

The team enters base camp control. Maps and blueprints arehung on the walls. Battle plans are being discussed. 

LIARA 
What is Saren researching? 

CAPTAIN KIRRAHE 
We think-

Kirrahe pauses as he looks at Wrex. 

CAPTAIN KIRRAHE (CONT’D)
We think they’re breeding an armyof Krogan. 

WREX 
How... is that possible? Ever since 
your people developed the Genophage-

CAPTAIN KIRRAHE 
It was necessary. Your ancestorshelped defeat the rachni, but yourrace grew powerful. Too strong. Tooviolent. Genophage developed as adeterrent. Can’t help that theTurians deployed it. In the end, itsaved lives. 

Wrex gets in Kirrahe’s face. 

WREX 
Saving lives? The Genophage was a 
biological weapon that mutated ourgenes! Ninety-nine point ninepercent of krogans die at birth. 
Save lives? 

CAPTAIN KIRRAHE 
Apparently... Saren has found a 
cure. 

(beat)
But it must be destroyed, alongwith Saren. 

WREX 
Destroy? I don’t think so. Ourpeople are dying. This cure cansave them. 

Shepard’s pulls Wrex away. 


66. 

SHEPARD 
Saren tried this with the rachni. 
He already has the geth. We can’t 
allow him to build a krogan army. 

Wrex shakes Shepard off. 

WREX 
These are my people! We don’tdeserve to lose this opportunity. 

Wrex walks off. 

CAPTAIN KIRRAHE 
I hope he won’t be a problem. 

ASHLEY 
Looks like he’s gonna blow agasket. 

SHEPARD 
He’ll be fine. Right now we need tofigure out how to stop Saren. 

CAPTAIN KIRRAHE 
Already working on it. 

EXT. SAREN’S BASE, FRONT ENTRANCE - LATER 

Geth sit behind armored turrets and snipers lay on the roof.
Sets of guards patrol. 

From the jungle in front of the base Captain Kirrahe standsin front twenty salarians, Garrus, Liara, and Kaidan. He 
paces back a forth. 

CAPTAIN KIRRAHE 
You all know the mission, and what 
is at stake. 
(beat)
I have come to trust each of youwith my life but I have also heardmurmurs of discontent. I share your 
concerns. 
(beat)
We are trained for espionage, gloryin battle is not our way.

We would be legends, but therecords are sealed.

67. 

CAPTAIN KIRRAHE (CONT'D) 
Our influence stopped the rachni 
wars, but before that we held the 
line! 
(beat)
Our influence stopped the kroganrebellions, but before that, we 
held the line! 
(beat)
Our influence will stop Saren; inthe battle today, we will hold theline! 

Kirrahe signals to go. 

Salarian snipers shoot the geth snipers on the roof. The restof the geth guards are immediately altered. 

Kirrahe’s team charges forward from the jungle. 

EXT. SAREN’S BASE, REAR 

Shepard, Ashley, Tali, and Wrex stand twenty feet away fromthe wall of Saren’s base. 

An explosive charge sticks to the wall. Shepard presses abutton. The charge EXPLODES. Debris and dust are everywhere. 

INT. SAREN’S BASE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 

Shepard’s team enter into a hallway. It’s empty. Wrex holds alarge BOMB. 

PA SYSTEM 
(repeating)
All units to front entrance. 
Emergency. 

The team runs down the hallway. Tali holds a map in her hand. 

TALI 
Third right. I hope this is 
accurate. 

SHEPARD 
I’d be more worried about Kirrahe 
than his intel. The geth will onlybe distracted so long. We have tomove fast. 

Shepard glances around a turn, at the end of the hall a gethsoldier runs by. Then another. And another. Clear. The teamheads down the hallway. 


68. 

TALI 
2nd left and down the stairs. 

EXT. SAREN’S BASE, FRONT ENTRANCE 

Salarian and Geth bodies cover the ground. What’s left ofKirrahe’s team are outside the main entrance. The entrance is 
open but geth guard it from the inside. 

Kirrahe signals to the jungle. Two salarians carry a BOMBidentical to the one Wrex had. 

A geth solider charges out. It shoots at the salarians. One 
salarian is killed. The bomb is dropped. 

Garrus shoots the geth. It’s destroyed. Another salarian 
soldier helps continue carrying the bomb. Kirrahe shakes hishead. 

CAPTAIN KIRRAHE 
Another loss. We won’t make it much 
further. Need to get inside. Needcover. Need Shepard. 

GARRUS 
Shepard will pull through. Healways does. 

INT. SAREN’S BASE, LAB 

Krogan bodies lay on operating tables. Others krogan stand in 
stasis tubes, asleep. Tali fiddles with the bomb Wrex hadcarried. Ashley and Shepard watch. 

TALI 
I know the salarians didn’t have 
much time, but the remote triggeron this is totally busted. I’llneed at least ten minutes to get itworking off a timer. 

SHEPARD 
Any longer than five and you risknone of us making it out alive. 

Ashley takes a look around. 

ASHLEY 
Uh... anyone know where Wrex went? 


69. 

INT. SAREN’S BASE, CONTROL ROOM 

Kirrahe, Garrus and Kaidan lead the remaining salariansoldiers into the control room. A brief firefight destroysfive geth. 

CAPTAIN KIRRAHE 
No sign of Saren. Must beevacuating. No matter. 

The bomb is carried in. 

CAPTAIN KIRRAHE (CONT’D)
We detonate in ten. Move out. 

The team heads out. A thought to be destroyed geth throws aplasma grenade. The EXPLOSION cuts off Kaidan and a fewsalarians from the rest of the team. Kaidan SHOOTS the gethover and over. Garrus’s voice comes through Kaidan’s radio. 

GARRUS 

(on radio)
Kaidan? Are you alright? We’relooking for another way in. 

Kaidan surveys the room. There are no other doors. 

KAIDAN 
You’ll never make it. Rendezvous 
with Shepard. Get out of here. 

GARRUS 

(on radio)
We’ll come back for you Kaidan!
We’ll be back. 

GUNSHOTS. The radio goes silent. Kaidan slumps to the floornext to explosive device. He looks out the window. 

INT. SAREN’S BASE, LAB 

Wrex is arguing with a VI, virtual intelligence program. TheVI appears as a human female hologram. 

VI 
I'm sorry, but the properauthorization code is required. 

WREX 
(mumbles)
Uh... Sic semper, tyranna... 

Wrex COUGHS. 


70. 

VI 
Access denied. 

WREX 
Tell me what I want or I’ll blast 
your virtual ass into actual dust! 

Shepard appears. 

SHEPARD 
Hey Wrex. 

WREX 
This isn’t right Shepard. Ifthere’s a cure for the Genophage, 
we can’t destroy it! 

SHEPARD 
Calm down, Wrex. I’m not the enemyhere. Saren is the one you shouldbe mad at. 

WREX 
Really? Saren created a cure for mypeople. You want to destroy it.
Help me out Shepard. The linesbetween friend and foe are gettinga little blurry from where I stand. 

SHEPARD 
I won’t let you jeopardize themission! 

Wrex pulls out his weapon. Shepard also. 

WREX 
Can’t you see what this means tothe krogan? 

SHEPARD 
Saren doesn’t care about these 
krogan! They’re tools! Puppets! 
He’ll destroy them as soon asthey’re no longer useful to him. Isthat what you want for your people? 

Shepard lowers his gun. 

WREX 
No. 

Wrex lowers his gun. 


71. 

WREX (CONT’D)
We were used as tools once already,
helping the council stop therachni. For what? Rewarded with the 
Genophage. 

(beat)
I doubt Saren will be as generous. 

SHEPARD 
You and I both know he won’t. 

Ashley and Tali join Shepard. 

TALI 
Clocks ticking. Fifteen minutes todetonation. 

There’s a tense feeling in the air. 

ASHLEY 
Did we miss something? 

Wrex shoots the VI computer. The Hologram fizzles out. 

WREX 
Nothing at all. 

EXT. SAREN’S BASE, DOCKING BAY 

Shepard’s team races into Saren’s docking bay. There isenough space for three ships. Only two geth ships are there.
Shepard activates his radio. 

SHEPARD 
Joker, we’re at the rendezvous 
point. We had to use a timer. Whereare you? Where’s Kirrahe? 

JOKER 

(on radio)
Kirrahe’s under fire. I’m pickingthem up now. Back around to pickyou up in ten. 

SHEPARD 
We won’t exist in ten. 

JOKER 
(on radio)
See you in eight. Joker out. 

Shepard’s team looks around. A pleasant silence. 


72. 

TALI 
So, we just wait? 

ASHLEY 
Unless you know how to hotwire a 
geth transport. 

SHEPARD 
Let me see those blueprints. 

Tali hands over the blueprints. Shepard takes a look. Hedrops the map and points at a side door. It says RESTRICTEDUSAGE. 

SHEPARD (CONT’D)
The salarians mentioned a strongenergy reading coming from thisroom. It’s worth a look. 

INT. SAREN’S BASE, BEACON ROOM 

Shepard’s team enters. A prothean beacon. It’s taller andmore imposing than the one on Eden Prime. A green essencesurrounds it. 

TALI 
A working prothean beacon. Amazing.
That explains the energy readings. 

ASHLEY 
But not why it’s here. 

WREX 
The closer to dock, the easier it’d 
be to shuttle it off planet. 

The Beacon looks entrenched in the ground. 

SHEPARD 
That beacon could hold the missingpieces of the vision. Of theConduit’s location. 

Shepard steps forward 

SHEPARD (CONT’D)
Whatever happens... stay back. 

The team stops. The closer Shepard walks to the beacon themore active it becomes. Circuits BUZZ. The green essencegrows. Lights inside the beacon activate. 


73. 

ASHLEY 
Shepard! 

Shepard is pulled toward the beacon. Images flash before hiseyes. Shepard collapses to the ground. Ashley runs to hisside and helps him to his feet. 

ASHLEY (CONT’D) 
Skipper... 

The beacon flashes. Above the beacon a red hologram appears.
It’s the massive ship from Eden Prime, SOVEREIGN. 

SOVEREIGN 
You are not Saren. 

Shepard is still recovering. 

ASHLEY 
What is that? Some kind of VI 
interface? 

SOVEREIGN 
Rudimentary creatures of blood andflesh, you touch my mind, fumblingin ignorance, incapable ofunderstanding. 

TALI 
I don't think this is a VI... 

SOVEREIGN 
There is a realm of existence so 
far beyond your own you cannot evenimagine it. I am beyond yourcomprehension. I am Sovereign. 

SHEPARD 
Sovereign isn't just some Reapership Saren found. It's an actualReaper! 

The team takes a step back. 

SOVEREIGN 
Reaper? A label created by theprotheans to give voice to theirdestruction. In the end, what theychose to call us is irrelevant. We 
simply... are. 


74. 

WREX 
The protheans vanished over 50,000 
years ago. You couldn't have beenthere, it's impossible! 

SOVEREIGN 
Organic life is nothing but agenetic mutation, an accident. Yourlives are measured in years anddecades. You wither and die. We are 
eternal, the pinnacle of evolutionand existence. Before us, you arenothing. Your extinction isinevitable. We are the end of 
everything. 

SHEPARD 
Whatever your plan is, it's goingto fail. I'll make sure of that. 

SOVEREIGN 
Confidence born of ignorance. Thecycle cannot be broken. 

ASHLEY 
Cycle? What cycle? 

SOVEREIGN 
The pattern has repeated itselfmore times than you can fathom.
Organic civilizations rise, evolve,
advance, and at the apex of theirglory they are extinguished. Theprotheans were not the first. Theydid not create the Citadel. Theydid not forge the mass relays. Theymerely found them - the legacy of 
my kind. 

SHEPARD 
Why would you construct the massrelays and leave them for someoneelse to find? 

SOVEREIGN 
Your civilization is based on the 
technology of the mass relays. Ourtechnology. By using it, yourcivilization develops along thepaths we desire. We impose order onthe chaos of organic evolution. Youexist because we allow it, and youwill end because we demand it. 


75. 

TALI 
They're harvesting us! Letting usadvance to the level they need,
then wiping us out! 

SHEPARD 
What do you want from us? Slaves?
Resources? 

SOVEREIGN 
My kind transcends your veryunderstanding. We are each a nation 

-independent, free of allweakness. You cannot grasp thenature of our existence. 
SHEPARD 
Where did you come from? Who builtyou? 

SOVEREIGN 
We have no beginning. We have noend. We are infinite. Millions of 
years after your civilization hasbeen eradicated and forgotten, wewill endure. 

SHEPARD 
Where are the rest of the Reapers?
Are you the last of your kind? 

SOVEREIGN 
We are legion. The time of ourreturn is coming. Our numbers willdarken the sky of every world. You 
cannot escape. 

SHEPARD 
You're not even alive! Not really.
You're just a machine, and machinescan be broken! 

SOVEREIGN 
Your words are as empty as yourfuture. I am the vanguard of yourdestruction. This exchange is over. 

The hologram shuts down. A low GRUMBLE. Ship engines turning 
on. 

SHEPARD 
The docking bay! 


76. 

INT. SAREN’S BASE, DOCKING BAY 

Saren and geth soldiers board the farthest ship. Shepard’steam enter the docking bay. 

Shepard tries to shoot Saren but the second ship, betweenthem, blocks his view. Shepard’s team uses the ship as cover. 

Saren’s ship continues it’s departure preparations. Landinggear folds in. 

Saren stands in the door frame. Shepard has a clear shot. HeShoots. Saren blocks the shot. He is protecting himself witha blue energy shield. 

SAREN 
I applaud you Shepard. My Geth wereutterly convinced the salarians 
were the only threat. An impressivediversion. Of course, it’s all for 
nothing. You can’t possiblyunderstand what’s really at stake. 

Shepard yells from his cover. 

SHEPARD 
It’s not complicated. You cravepower. And you’re willing topartner with anyone to get it. Eventhe Reapers. 

SAREN 
Shepard. You’ve seen the visionsfrom the beacon. You of all peopleshould know what the Reapers arecapable of. They cannot be stopped.
Do not mire yourself in pointlessrevolt. Do not sacrifice everythingfor the sake of petty freedoms. Theprotheans tried to fight, but wereutterly destroyed. Trillions dead. 

Shepard takes aims again at Saren. 

SAREN (CONT’D)
But what if they had bowed beforetheir invaders? Would the protheansstill exist? Is submission not 
preferable to extinction? 

SHEPARD 
I’d rather die than live under the 
rule of those machine! 


77. 

Shepard fires. Blocked by Saren. 

SAREN 
Now you see why I never cameforward with this to the council. 
We organics are driven by emotioninstead of logic. We will fight.
Even when we know we cannot win. 
But, if we work with the Reapers.
If we make ourselves useful, think 
how many lives could be spared. 

Saren’s ship begins to hover. It’s engines IGNITE. 

SAREN (CONT’D)
Once I understood this, I joinedSovereign. I was aware of thedangers. 

SHEPARD 
You’re just another blind tool forSovereign. Indoctrinated. In theend he’s just going to toss youaside. 

SAREN 
Do not lecture me on 
indoctrination. A tool? Maybe. Butuseful. My way is the only way anyof us will survive. Sovereign’svictory is absolute. 

SHEPARD 
You were a spectre. You were swornto defend the galaxy! 

SAREN 
I am forging an alliance, and indoing so, will save more lives thanhave ever existed! You will undo mywork. Undo civilizations salvation. 
I will not let that happen. We willmeet again Shepard. And on thatday, salvation will come. 

Saren presses a button. The door shuts. The transport takesoff. Shepard’s team shoots futilely after them. Shepard getson his radio. 

SHEPARD 
Joker, where are you? 


78. 

KAIDAN 

(over radio)
He should be any second. Picked upKirrahe’s team five minutes ago. 

SHEPARD 
Kaidan? Where are you? 

KAIDAN 
(over radio)
I’m not coming back with you, Sir. 

The Normandy arrives. Shepard’s team boards. Geth enter thedocking bay. They fire at the Normandy. 

SHEPARD 
No soldier left behind! 

KAIDAN 

(over radio)
I appreciate the gesture, but youand I both know if you come backfor me, nobody makes it out alive.
It was a pleasure serving under 
you. 

INT. SAREN’S BASE, CONTROL ROOM 

Kaidan switches off his radio. He watches the Normandy leave. 

KAIDAN 
God speed. 

INT. NORMANDY, COMMAND DECK 

Shepard watches Saren’s base fade into the distance. Itexplodes. A moment. The whole team has been watching. 

SHEPARD 
If we don’t find the Conduit. If we 
don’t stop Saren. If we don’teliminate the Reapers, all is lost.
Kaidan died for nothing. Kirrahe’smen died for nothing. We’ve come along way, but it’s far from over.

(beat)
Joker, set course for the citadel. 
Liara, we found another beacon, 
I’ll need to join minds again. Thisvision was complete. It may holdthe key to the finding the Conduit. 


79. 

EXT. VIRMIRE 

The Normandy exits the Virmire atmosphere. 

INT. CITADEL TOWER - EVENING 

Citadel Tower is full of people, a busy day. 

INT. CITADEL COUNCIL 

Shepard, Liara, and Ashley reach the council at the top ofthe steps. Two TURIAN CITIZENS and an ASARI CITIZEN arespeaking with the council. 

SHEPARD 
Urgent matter. Spectre clearance. 

Shepard and team walk in front of the turians and asari. 

TURIAN CITIZEN 
I’ve never heard such a thing! I’vewaited weeks to speak to thecouncil! 

SHEPARD 
You’ll need to wait another few 
minutes. 

Ashley and Liara form a wall. The aliens step back and giveup their protesting. 

TURIAN COUNCILOR 
Shepard. We read your report. Noneed for these... heroics. 

SHEPARD 
You read the report, and yet you donothing! 

SALARIAN COUNCILOR 
You’ve exposed Saren. Destroyed hisplans. He’ll be on the run now. 

SHEPARD 
Saren isn’t the real threat! 

SALARIAN COUNCILOR 
Saren still has an army of geth. Is 
that not a threat? 


80. 

TURIAN COUNCILOR 
The Citadel joint-species fleet isgathering. When ready, we will goafter Saren. 

SHEPARD 
We need to go now. Saren is on theway to the Conduit! If he activatesit, the Reapers have already won. 

TURIAN COUNCILOR 
Ah yes, Reapers. Again. There’sstill no proof they exist. 

SHEPARD 
They already wiped out theprotheans! If we do nothing, we’re 
next. 

SALARIAN COUNCILOR 
There is no evidence Reapers, orSovereign being a Reaper, exists. 

SHEPARD 
You didn’t believe me about Saren 
either. Sooner or later you’regoing to have to take something Isay on faith, counselors! 

TURIAN COUNCILOR 
You humans have a saying... even abroken clock is right twice a day. 

SHEPARD 
We have another saying. Go to hell! 

ASARI COUNCILOR 
Enough! Commander Shepard, youperformed admirably so far. Still,
Saren is a recognizable threat,
while the Reapers only exist inyour visions. 

Shepard looks at Liara. 

LIARA 
The Virmire beacon was intact, a 
complete vision! It is... was, adistress call. A message sent outacross the prothean Empire. Awarning against the Reapers, but,
the warning came to late. It points 
to Ilos, the location of the 
Conduit. 

(MORE) 


81. 

LIARA (CONT'D) 
Only accessible through the longlost, and now found, Mu Relay. 

Ambassador Udina rushes up to the council chamber. 

TURIAN COUNCILOR 
The Mu Relay is not in CitadelSpace. Eventually, Saren will leavethe system. Until then, we willgather our own fleet. 

SALARIAN COUNCILOR 
Our decisions effect trillions of 
lives. 

Udina pulls Shepard’s aside for a personal talk. 

UDINA 
Shepard, now is the time fordiscretion! The Council is preppinga fleet. What more do you want? 

Shepard brushes off Udina and turns back to the council. 

SHEPARD 
If Saren finds the Conduit, we’re 
all screwed. I’m going to Ilos! 

TURIAN COUNCILOR 
Ambassador Udina, I’m afraid 
Shepard isn’t going to let this go. 

UDINA 
There are serious politicalimplications here Shepard. Humanityhas made great gains thanks to you,
but now you’re becoming moretrouble than you’re worth. 

ASHLEY 
You’re selling us out! 

UDINA 
Just politics. You’ve done yourjob. Now, let me do mine. 

Udina addresses the Council. 

UDINA (CONT’D)
I’ll see that the Normandy begrounded until further notice.
Shepard, I think it’s time for youto go. The Council can handle thisthemselves, with my help of course. 


82. 

Shepard doesn’t move. The Council and Udina look back at him,
impatient. Shepard realizes he isn’t going to win them over.
He turns and leaves. Liara and Ashley share a disappointedglance and follow him out. 

EXT. FLUX BAR - NIGHT 

In the Citadel Presidium, the Neon sign FLUX illuminates. 

INT. FLUX BAR - CONTINUOUS 

It is a trendy nightclub. Dance music blares, lights flash,
and aliens are dancing. Shepard, drink in hand, sits alone.
He looks out to the crowd. A bartender serves a group ofasari friends. Tourists get their picture taken in front of akeeper. A couple feed each other food, and kiss. 

SHEPARD 
They don’t even know. 

Captain Anderson walks up the table and takes a seat. 

ANDERSON 
I know. 

Shepard does a double take. 

ANDERSON (CONT’D)
I know you’re pissed off right now,
but you can’t give up. They allthink this is over, but we both 
know it’s not. You must go to Ilos 
and stop Saren from using theConduit! 

SHEPARD 
There’s only one ship that can makeit through the Terminus Systemsundetected, and she’s grounded. 

ANDERSON 
Udina issued the lockdown order, he 
can also release it. Using hisoffice computer, I’ll be able tosend an official message to CitadelControl and override the lockdown. 

SHEPARD 
Come on, Anderson! He’s not goingto allow you into his office. 


83. 

ANDERSON 
Hopefully he won’t be there. If heis... I’ll just have to think ofsomething. 

SHEPARD 
Udina won’t let this slide. He’ll 
charge you with treason! 

ANDERSON 
We’re out of options. 

SHEPARD 
What about my crew? They’re allover the Citadel. 

ANDERSON 
Already told them you’re on your 
way. 

Shepard smiles. 

ANDERSON (CONT’D)
You ready to get the hell off thisstation, Commander? 

Shepard pounds his fist against the table. 

SHEPARD 
Let’s do this. 

ANDERSON 
I’ll take care of the lockdown, you 
get to the Normandy and tell Jokerto standby. You’ll be on Ilos 
before anyone knows you’re gone. 

Shepard stands. Anderson stands. 

SHEPARD 
Jail and certain death. I alwayspictured happier outcomes for us. 

ANDERSON 
I wouldn’t have it any other way. 

EXT. CITADEL, HANGER - LATER 

The Normandy sits silently in the Citadel hanger. Two largecranes hold the Normandy firmly in place. 


84. 

INT. NORMANDY COCKPIT 

Shepard stands behind Joker. They stare at a large red buttonon the main cockpit console. It fades on and off. 

INT. UDINA’S OFFICE 

TYPING. Ambassador Udina works on his computer. A fewpaintings of famous Earth leaders are on the wall. 

INT. NORMANDY COCKPIT 

Shepard and Joker continue to stare at the button. 

SHEPARD 
So, uh, why do you have that buttonanyway? 

JOKER 
Safety feature? 

INT. UDINA’S OFFICE 
DING. The office door opens and Anderson struts forward. 
UDINA 
Anderson? 
Anderson keeps walking, says nothing. 
UDINA (CONT’D)
What are you doing here? 
Udina is confused. Anderson has reached his desk. 
UDINA (CONT’D)
I, didn’t send for you-
Anderson punches Udina in the face. He’s knocked out.
Anderson types away at his computer. 

INT. NORMANDY COCKPIT 

Joker is tapping his foot and clicking his pen. 

JOKER 
I see you chatting up the crew alot. Especially



85. 

SHEPARD 
Especially who? 

Shepard is not in the mood for small talk. 

JOKER 
Uh... nobody. No one. 

They go back to staring at the button. BUZZ. The button turns 
green. 

SHEPARD 
Joker, get us out of here! 

Joker slams the button. Shepard runs off. 

EXT. CITADEL, HANGER 

The cranes release the Normandy and it’s engines IGNITE. 

EXT. CITADEL 

A small fleet gathers. The Normandy leaves the Citadel. 

EXT. SPACE 

A Mass Relay stands alone in space. The Normandy arrives. 

EXT. MASS RELAY 

The Normandy flies the length of the relay. When the Normandyreaches the end it’s ZAPPED and disappears as it shootsforward. 

EXT. MU MASS RELAY 

The Normandy reappears. Ilos is in the distance, a rust 
colored planet. GETH WARSHIPS surround the planet. 

INT. NORMANDY, COMMAND DECK 

The Normandy crew are at their work stations. Shepard and histeam gather in the command deck. Joker speaks from theintercom. 

JOKER (O.S.)
Shepard, I spot a geth. Orthousand. 


86. 

LIARA 
Have their sensors picked us up?? 

JOKER (O.S.)
Stealth systems engaged. Unless weget close enough for a visual, theywon’t have any idea we’re here. 

GARRUS 
Commander? 

Garrus stands behind a work station. 

SHEPARD 
Garrus? 

GARRUS 
We’re getting strong readingscoming from Ilos. One area in 
particular. 

SHEPARD 
Take us down, Joker. Garrus, send 
over the coordinates. 

Garrus presses some buttons. 

JOKER (O.S.)
Negative commander, no clearlanding zone for miles. 

ASHLEY 
We’ll never make it in time on 
foot! Find us somewhere close! 

GARRUS 
There’s nowhere closer. This planetused to be a metropolis before itwas destroyed. There’s not muchroom left for landing zones. 

Shepard takes in the information 

SHEPARD 
Drop us in the mako. 

ASHLEY 
What! 

TALI 
You need at least 100 meters of 
open terrain to pull off a droplike that! 


87. 

GARRUS 
The most I can find near those 
readings... twenty. 

ASHLEY 
Twenty? Meters? No way we can makea drop in there! 

LIARA 
We have to try! Saren’s aheadenough as it is! 

ASHLEY 
Find another landing zone! 

GARRUS 
There are no others! 

TALI 
The descent angle’s too steep. 

LIARA 
But our only option! 

ASHLEY 
It’s not an option, it’s a suiciderun! We can’t-

JOKER (O.S.)
I can do it. 

SHEPARD 
Joker? 

JOKER (O.S.)
I can do it. 

SHEPARD 
Everyone gear up and head down tothe mako. Joker, drop us right ontop of the bastards if you need to. 

EXT. ILOS - DAY 

The Normandy enters Ilos’s upper atmosphere. The ground iscovered by the crumbled remains of prothean civilization.
Vines and weeds cover most of the remains. 

EXT. ILOS, RUINED CITY 

The Normandy flies above the ruined skyline. The twenty meterlanding zone nears. 


88. 

The mako is released out the back of the Normandy. It fallsright into the target area, on top of a Geth battalion. 

INT. MAKO 

Garrus drives. Ashley mans the turret. Wrex fires the cannon. 

EXT. ILOS, RUINED CITY 

Turret FIRE and Cannon BURSTS. The geth are destroyed. Themako takes little damage. 

INT. MAKO 

Ashley lets go of the turret controls. 

ASHLEY 
Skipper, you did say to drop us ontop of them! 

SHEPARD 
Yes I did! Let’s keep moving.
Follow the readings. 

EXT. ILOS, RUINED CITY 

The mako drives on. The ruins are equal part marveling andsad. Large sections of the city are built into the surface ofthe planet. Buildings made of steel, and of stone. The longerthey travel, the more it changes into all stone buildings. 

INT. MAKO 

The team look at the ruins. 

WREX 
It’s a ghost town. 

EXT. ILOS, RUINED CITY 

The ruined city turns into just ruins. Vague shapes remain,
some look like temples and religious sites. Amidst the ruinsstands a large intact bunker. It is covered in vines andsurrounded by dying trees. 


89. 

INT. MAKO 

The team look at the bunker. 

ASHLEY 
It’s like they built a fortress inthe middle of nowhere. 

SHEPARD 
Liara, what kind of protheanarchitecture is that? 

LIARA 
I’ve never seen anything like thisin my research. Nothing even comesclose. 

SHEPARD 
The Conduit has to be in there. Be 
on your toes, geth are perfectambushers. They don’t breath, make 
noise, and are ever alert. 

ASHLEY 
Sir, they have flashlights forheads. 

Shepard cracks a smile. The team lightly chuckles. 

EXT. ILOS, RUINS 

The mako rolls forward. A blue energy field turns on,
blocking the entrance to the bunker. To the right of theentrance a hologram appears. It is mangled and impossible totell the alien it was supposed to represent. 

INT. MAKO 

Shepard looks at the hologram, then to his team. 

SHEPARD 
Liara, Ashley, come with me. 

GARRUS 
Don’t worry, I’ll stay right here! 

SHEPARD 
Tali take over driving. Garrus, the 
turret. 

GARRUS 
Beats driving. 


90. 

EXT. PROTHEAN BUNKER 

Shepard, Ashley, and Liara approach the hologram. It standson a pedestal that says VIGIL. It speaks to the team. 

VIGIL 
You are not prothean. But you arenot machine either. And, I do not 
sense the taint of indoctrination 
upon any of you, unlike the othersthat passed recently. Perhaps thereis still hope. 

ASHLEY 
Looks like some kind of VI program.
Pretty badly damaged. 

VIGIL 
I am an advanced non-organicanalysis system with personalityimprints from Kasad Ishon, Chief 
overseer of the Ilos research 
facility. 

LIARA 
This is incredible! An actual 
prothean VI! And I can understandit! 

VIGIL 
I have been monitoring allcommunication since the arrivals 
here. I have translated my outputinto a format you will comprehend.
My name is Vigil. You are safehere, for the moment, but soon, 
nowhere will be safe. 

SHEPARD 
Vigil, we must stop Saren, the onewho came before us. You need to let 
us through, now! 

VIGIL 
Dropping shield. 

The energy shield drops. A compartment shoots out fromVigil’s pedestal. A slim disc is inside. 

VIGIL (CONT’D)
You could have only found Ilos 
through our beacons, but you willstill need my help if you wish tostop the Reapers. 


91. 

Shepard looks at Liara and Ashley. They shrug. 

ASHLEY 
I don’t have a better idea. 

Shepard picks up the disc. Vigil disappears from the pedestaland reappears as a smaller hologram that projects from thedisc. The team walks toward the bunker entrance. 

INT. PROTHEAN BUNKER 

The mako enters the bunker with Shepard, Liara and Ashleywalking next to it. A main road cuts through the bunker. Manyalleys and side streets veer away from the main road. Thebunker shakes. The team continues forward at a brisk pace. 

SHEPARD 
Vigil, if we stop Saren, we stopthe Reapers. Why do we need yourhelp? 

VIGIL 
You must break a cycle that hascontinued for millions of years.
But to stop it you must understand.
Or, you will make the same mistakeswe did. 

The bunker shakes again and loud FOOTSTEPS echo throughoutthe bunker. 

VIGIL (CONT’D)
The Citadel is the heart of yourcivilization, as it was with us, 
and every civilization before us.
But the Citadel is a trap. Thestation is actually an enormousmass relay. One that links to darkspace, the empty void beyond thegalaxy’s horizon. When the Citadelrelay is activated, the Reaperswill pour through. And all you knowwill be destroyed. 

FOOTSTEPS grow more frequent and louder. 

SHEPARD 
If Saren turns on the Citadel 
relay, the Reapers will wipe outthe Council and Citadel fleet in 
one fell swoop! 


92. 

VIGIL 
That was out fate. Our leaders were 
dead before we even realized we 
were under attack. The Reapersseized control of the Citadel and 
through it, the mass relays.
Communication and transportationacross our empire was crippled.
Each star system was isolated, cutoff from the others. Easy pray forthe Reaper fleets. Over the nextdecades, the Reapers systematicallyobliterated our people. World byWorld. System by System. Theymethodically wiped us out. 

LIARA 
I feel sick. 

The main road takes a dip and declines underground. The makoleads forward. 

INT. MAKO 

The bunker shakes again. Rocks fall and CLUNK against themako. Garrus spots a GETH COLOSSUS. The Colossus has the headof a geth, but stands on four legs with a long neck. It isthree stories high. Tali picks up her radio. 

TALI 
Shepard! Colossus! 

INT. PROTHEAN BUNKER 

Shepard spots the Colossus. A dozen geth soldiers travel with 
it. 

SHEPARD 
(rhetorically, to team)
Any bright ideas? 

VIGIL 
Aim for the head? 

INT. PROTHEAN BUNKER, BASEMENT 

The team reach the bottom of the decline. The bunker’s 
basement walls are seven stories high, tiled with 4x4 square-
foot doors. Some of the doors are open. Pods, partially andfully, stick out. They are too high to see what is inside. 


93. 

The main road is littered with fallen rock, debris, statues, 
and deteriorating plant life. Shepard turns to the team. 

SHEPARD 
We deal with the Colossus, and race 
ahead as fast as we can to Saren. 
He can’t be too much farther. 

Liara summons an energy ball. Ashley checks her weapon. 

INT. MAKO 

Tali makes adjustments at the mako’s main console. Wrex andGarrus aim the turret and cannon. 

INT. PROTHEAN BUNKER, BASEMENT 

Shepard motions for Tali to keep the mako where it is. 

From cover to cover, Shepard’s team make their way forward. 

Shepard’s team stops, halfway between the mako and theColossus. Shepard signals back to Tali. 

INT. MAKO 

Tali nods to Wrex. 

TALI 
Make it count, Wrex. 

WREX 
Always do. 

Wrex fires. 

INT. PROTHEAN BUNKER, BASEMENT 

The mako’s cannon fires. BOOM. The Colossus is hit. It is 
unaffected by the blast. The Colossus and geth battalion turnaround and open fire. 

SHEPARD 

(into radio)
Shields! You’re going to have topound it until they fall. We can’tget any closer. We’ll distract itas long as we can! 

Shepard and Ashley open fire. One geth falls. 


94. 

Liara shoots an energy ball at the Colossus. It turns towardLiara. Each step causes the ground to shake and RUMBLE. 

INT. MAKO 
Wrex and Garrus open fire on the Colossus. 

INT. PROTHEAN BUNKER, BASEMENT 

The Colossus shoots a plasma beam at Liara. It destroys theruins she was using for cover. Liara is blown back, into the 
open. 

The mako fire hits the Colossus. It is constant. The Colossus 
is pushed back. It turns back to the mako and fires. 

INT. MAKO 
Tali shifts the mako into reverse. 

INT. PROTHEAN BUNKER, BASEMENT 

The mako reverses behind some ruins. The Colossus beam justmisses the mako. 
Geth troops aim at Liara. Shepard and Ashley pick them off. 
Liara retreats behind a prothean statue. 
The Colossus BLASTS the ruins the mako was hiding behind.

Another Colossus BLAST. The mako is hit blind-sided. 

INT. MAKO 

The mako rocks. ALARMS sound and sparks fly. Wrex and Garrusare knocked away from their controls. 

INT. PROTHEAN BUNKER, BASEMENT 
Liara is pinned down behind the statue. 
Ashley and Shepard fire at the geth soldiers, drawing fire 

away. 

Liara summons the largest energy ball we’ve seen and shootsat the Colossus. Liara is shot by a geth. 
BANG! The Colossus is hit. Sparks fly. Smoke rises from it. 


95. 

SHEPARD 
(into radio)
Shields are down! Hit it! 

INT. MAKO 

Garrus and Wrex crawl to their seats. They try to aim. 

EXT. PROTHEAN BUNKER, BASEMENT 

The mako’s turret barely moves. It’s jammed. 

INT. MAKO 

Tali looks on impatiently. Garrus tries again. 

GARRUS 
It won’t budge! 

Tali looks to Wrex. He shakes his head. 

TALI 
It must have knocked out the 
targeting system. 

GARRUS 
We’re sitting ducks. 

WREX 
Not if I can help it. 

EXT. PROTHEAN BUNKER, BASEMENT 

Geth concentrate fire on Shepard and Ashley. The ruins theyhide behind are falling apart. Liara is too hurt to help.
Shepard notices the RUMBLE of the mako’s engine. 

The mako drives straight at the Colossus. Wrex is on top ofthe mako. Using brute strength, Wrex manually adjusts thecannon trajectory. Wrex BANGS the mako to signal he’s ready. 

INT. MAKO 

Tali pushes the mako’s pedal to the floor while dodging ruinand debris. 

GARRUS 
We need to be closer! 


96. 

TALI 
We’re out of time! 

The mako hits a rock and bounces. Garrus fires the cannon. 

EXT. PROTHEAN BUNKER, BASEMENT 
The cannon blast hits the wall behind the Colossus. Miss. 
Wrex watches in horror as the Colossus returns fire. It’s 

plasma beam shoots straight at them. 

INT. MAKO 
Tali looks at the oncoming plasma beam. 
TALI 
Hold on! 
Tali activates the mako thrusters. 

EXT. PROTHEAN BUNKER, BASEMENT 

The mako, still speeding forward, ignites the THRUSTERS. Themako lifts into the air. 
Shepard watches the mako travel over his head. 
The Colossus plasma beam shoots under the mako. 
The mako lands hard onto the ground. Wrex falls off the side,

holding onto the mako cannon with one hand. 
The Colossus targets the mako. 

INT. MAKO 

Tali speeds forward and runs over some geth. The makobounces. 

TALI 
One more shot! Wrex! 

EXT. PROTHEAN BUNKER, BASEMENT 
Wrex pulls himself back up. 


97. 

INT. MAKO 
Tali steers with one hand, and gets ready to hit thethrusters with the other. 
TALI 
Hold on! 
Tali hits the thrusters. 

EXT. PROTHEAN BUNKER, BASEMENT 
The thrusters raise the mako up. 
Wrex readjusts his shot. 

INT. MAKO 
Garrus fires the cannon. 

EXT. PROTHEAN BUNKER, BASEMENT 

The mako’s cannon BLASTS the Colossus in the head. The head 
EXPLODES and the Colossus crumbles to the ground. 
The mako lands. Garrus and Tali jump out of the mako and join

Wrex. They destroy the remaining Geth. 
Ashley and Shepard run over to Liara. 
SHEPARD 
Liara! 
LIARA 
I’m fine Shepard, don’t worry about 
me. 
Liara’s shoulder is bleeding. Shepard whistles at the mako. 
SHEPARD 

Garrus, we need a medkit! 
Shepard helps Liara up. He sits her on some debris. 
Garrus arrives with a medkit. 

GARRUS 
Mako’s busted. Tali and Wrex are on 
it. We’ll be up and running infive. 


98. 

VIGIL 

We must keep moving. We cannot let

the Reapers reach the Citadel once 

more. 

Garrus and Tali tend to Liara’s wound. 

Shepard speaks with Vigil. 

VIGIL (CONT’D)

Through the Citadel, the Reapers

had access to all our records, 

maps, census data. Information is

power, and they knew everything

about us. Their fleets advanced 

across every region in the galaxy.

Some worlds were utterly destroyed,

others were conquered, their

populations enslaved. These

indoctrinated servants became 

sleeper agents under Reaper

control, taken in as refugees by

other protheans. They betrayed them 

to the machines. Within a few 

centuries the Reapers had killed or

enslaved every prothean in the

galaxy. They were relentless,

brutal, and absolutely thorough. 

SHEPARD 

We will stop them. How deadly is

the Conduit? 

LIARA 

And what happens if Saren finds it

before us? Ouch! 

Garrus presses down on Liara’s wound. 

VIGIL 

The Conduit is the key. Before the

Reapers attacked, we protheans were 

on the cusp of unlocking the

mysteries behind mass relay

technology. Ilos was a top secret

facility. Here, researchers worked

to create a small scale version of 

a mass relay. One that linked

directly to the Citadel, the hub of

the relay network. 

SHEPARD 

The Conduit isn’t a weapon! It’s a

back-door onto the Citadel! 


99. 

Garrus and Ashley help Liara up. 

The team walk her back to the mako. 

LIARA 

What happened to your research

facility? 

VIGIL 

We lost all communication with the 

outside and our facility went dark.

Personnel retreated underground,

into these archives. To conserve 

resources, everyone was put into

cryogenic stasis. I was programmed

to monitor the facility and wake

the staff when the danger had

passed. But the genocide of an

entire species is a long, slow

process. Years passed. Decades.

Centuries. The Reapers persisted.

And my energy reserves were

dwindling. 

SHEPARD 
And yet you still have power. 

VIGIL 

I began to disable the life support

of non-essential personal. First

support staff. Then security. One

by one their pods were shut down to

conserve energy. Eventually only

the stasis pods of the top

scientists remained active. Even 

these were in danger of failing

when the Reapers finally retreated

back through the Citadel relay. 

The team walk by a stasis pod opened from the fighting. Thepod holds only dusty remains. 

LIARA 

There are hundreds of stasis pods

in here! Thousands! 

VIGIL 

My actions were the result of

contingency programming entered

upon my creation. I saved key

personal. 


100. 

ASHLEY 
I bet they didn’t tell the nonessential 
staff about this 
contingency! 

The team arrives back at the mako. 

Wrex is hitting the turret with some tools. 

Tali slides out from under the mako. 

TALI 
She’ll hold together, for a littlewhile longer. 

INT. MAKO 

The entire team sits in the mako. 

With a RUMBLE, Tali turns on the mako. 

SHEPARD 
Full speed ahead. 

EXT. PROTHEAN BUNKER, BASEMENT 

The mako drives forward. 

INT. MAKO 

Vigil is the only light inside the mako. 

LIARA 
So, what happened? 

VIGIL 
When the Reapers retreated and thetop researchers woke, they realizedthe prothean species was doomed.
Only dozens remained. 

LIARA 
That’s horrible! 

VIGIL 
Yet, they vowed to find some way tostop the Reapers from returning. Away to break the cycle forever. Andthey knew the keepers were the key. 


101. 

WREX 

Keepers? Those useless Citadel

creatures? 

VIGIL 

The keepers are controlled by the

Citadel. Before each invasion a 

signal is sent through the station

compelling the keepers to activate

the Citadel relay and let the

Reapers through. After decades of

feverish study the scientists

discovered a way to alter this

signal. Using the Conduit, the

researchers gained access to the

Citadel and made the necessary

modifications. This time, when 

Sovereign sent the signal to the

Citadel, the Keepers ignored it.

The Reapers are trapped in dark 

space. 

SHEPARD 

Saren’s using the Conduit to reach

the Citadel and manually give

control of the station back to 

Sovereign! Sovereign will then

allow the Reapers back through! 

VIGIL 

Correct. And the cycle of

extinction will begin again. 

A low RUMBLE shakes the mako. 

It’s grows louder and more violent. 

A flash of blue light blinds everything. 

EXT. PROTHEAN BUNKER, BASEMENT 

The light fades away. The RUMBLE quiets to a standstill. 

Ahead of the mako is the bunker’s basement exit. 

Through it, a half-mile away, is a miniature mass relay, theConduit. 

EXT. THE CONDUIT EXPRESSWAY 

The Conduit is brought to life. It works. 


102. 

The half mile expressway between the mako and Conduit hasfour geth battalions and three geth colossus. 

The mako stops. 

INT. MAKO 
The team stare at the geth. Ashley breaks the silence. 
ASHLEY 
For Kaidan. 
WREX 
Glory! 
TALI 
Peace. 
GARRUS 
Vengeance. 
LIARA 
My mother. 
SHEPARD 
For everyone. For all those thatdon’t know what’s at stake. 
There is a moment of silence. 
SHEPARD (CONT’D) 
Hit it! 

EXT. THE CONDUIT EXPRESSWAY 
The mako speeds down the Conduit expressway. 
It passes the first Geth battalion and keeps going. 
They pass the first Colossus. It fires. Miss. 
The mako swerves back and forth, dodging fire. 
They are a quarter mile from the Conduit. It looms large in

front of them. 

EXT. CITADEL 
A Geth warship appears from space. Another. And another. 


103. 

Sovereign arrives, ten times bigger than any other ship. Gethwarships continue to arrive around it. 

They speed toward the Citadel and open fire. 

The Citadel fleet and Citadel itself are hit with heavy fire.
Explosions rock the Citadel. 

Citadel ships are outnumbered ten to one. Some ships areobliterated from the massive amounts of firepower. 

One Citadel fleet ship is larger than the rest, the DESTINYASCENSION. It is hit with a massive blast. 

INT. DESTINY ASCENSION, COMMAND DECK 

The ship RUMBLES from a hit. An ASARI CAPTAIN loses herbalance. An ASARI PILOT hangs on to the steering controls. 

ASARI CAPTAIN 
Activate the defences! Seal the 
Citadel! 

ASARI PILOT 
The arms aren’t moving! CitadelSystems aren’t responding! 

Another explosion causes TREMORS throughout the ship. 

The Asari Captain pauses for a moment in thought. 

ASARI CAPTAIN 

(with regret)
Abandon the Citadel! Evacuate the 
Council! Prep for their transfer! 

Asari Pilot holds down a button. 

ASARI PILOT 
Citadel Control! 
(beat)
Citadel Control, do you copy? 

INT. CITADEL, CONTROL 

Asari and Turian bodies lay face down on computer consoles.
Over the radio Asari Pilot pleads for help. 

Saren and three geth bodyguards leave the room. 


104. 

EXT. THE CONDUIT EXPRESSWAY 

The mako dodges another Colossus blast two hundred meters tothe Conduit. 

INT. MAKO 

Tali swerves back and forth. 

Shepard looks ahead, but shouts so everyone can hear. 

SHEPARD 
Saren’s already through. We’ll needto move fast and efficiently ifwe’re going to catch him. 

VIGIL 
Saren will be heading to theCitadel’s master control unit. 
Upload me to into it. I’m able tocorrupt the Citadel’s securityprotocols and give you temporarycontrol of the station. I will be 
destroyed in the process, but giveyou a chance against Sovereign. 

SHEPARD 
Vigil. It’s been an honor. 

VIGIL 
Good luck. Your fight has justbegun. 

Shepard turns off Vigil and pockets the disc. 

SHEPARD 
Everyone hold on! 

EXT. THE CONDUIT 

The mako is smoking and about to fall apart. 

A Colossus BLAST behind the mako propels it forward, into theConduit. 

The Conduit shoots the mako into the sky. BANG! Itdisappears. 

INT. CITADEL PRESIDIUM 

The Citadel Presidium is destroyed, fire everywhere. 


105. 

Two Geth soldiers stand in front the mass relay monument. TheRUMBLE of the mako’s engine grows. The two geth lookcuriously at the monument. 

BANG! The mako shoots through the mass relay monument,
crushing the geth soldiers. The mako flips on it’s side androlls to a stop. 

The team crawls out from under the mako. 

Shepard looks up at the Citadel tower. 

SHEPARD 
Citadel master control will be in 
the council chambers. 

Shepard heads toward the tower elevator. 

INT. CITADEL TOWER 
Saren walks up the stairs to the Council chambers. 
He passes by a keeper and shoots it. And another. 

INT. CITADEL COUNCIL 

Saren stands at the master controls in the council chamber. 
He brings up a large holographic screen and makes a fewadjustments. 

EXT. CITADEL

The station! The wards are closing! 

ASARI CAPTAIN 
By the goddess... 

The Asari Captain looks out the window. The Citadel wards areclosing. 

EXT. CITADEL 

Sovereign heads straight toward the closing station. 

INT. DESTINY ASCENSION COMMAND DECK 

Asari Captain sees the enemy ships approaching the Citadel. 

ASARI CAPTAIN 
Focus on stopping all enemy shipsfrom getting inside the Citadel! 

EXT. CITADEL 

Ships fire on Sovereign, but it does not slow down. 

Sovereign SMASHES right through a Citadel ship in it’s path. 

The wards SHUDDER closed just as Sovereign passes through. 


107. 

INT. CLOSED CITADEL 

Sovereign travels the length of the closed Citadel. TheCitadel is massive, even compared with Sovereign’s size. 
Sovereign leeches onto the top of Citadel Tower. 

INT. CITADEL TOWER, ELEVATOR 
Shepard and team head up a citadel tower elevator. It’s a

glass exterior elevator that enables the team to survey thedestruction on the way up. 
With a SCREECH the elevator stops. 
Shepard aims his gun at the elevator window. 

SHEPARD 
No stopping! We’re going outside! 
The team flip switches on their suits. 

EXT. CITADEL TOWER 
Shepard turns a dial on his boots. His boots HUM. 
Shepard shoots the elevator. 
With THUMP he takes a step outside. Another footstep, another

THUMP. The boots keep Shepard attached to the tower. 

Shepard starts running, at a ninety-degree angle to theground, up the outside of the tower. The team follows. 
A half-mile up Sovereign is imposingly attached to the tower 

top. 
The team runs forward. 
Ahead of the team glass shatters from the tower side. Geth

soldiers come out. Shepard’s team takes cover. 
The Geth soldiers also take cover. 
TALI 
They’re camping out! 
Ashley shoots at the geth in vain. They fire back. 
ASHLEY 
They’re just trying to delay us! 


108. 

LIARA 
We don’t have much time! 

SHEPARD 
We’re out of time! Ashley! Liara!
With me! Wrex, Garrus, Tali, 
provide cover fire! 

The Shepard’s team runs across the Citadel tower side. 

The rest of the team fire at the geth. 

Shepard’s team rounds the tower’s side. More geth. 

ASHLEY 
We have to go back! 

SHEPARD 
No, it’s what they want us to do. 

LIARA 
It’s the only option! 

SHEPARD 
There’s one other. 

INT. CITADEL TOWER 
Shepard’s team crash through side windows and onto the floor. 
The team looks up at the stairs leading to the council

chamber. 
Dragon’s teeth have been placed all around the tower. 
SCREAMS as husks appear and run at the team. 
The team run up the stairs. Husks attack from all sides. 

EXT. CITADEL 
The Citadel fleet is now grossly outnumbered by Geth ships. 

INT. DESTINY ASCENSION COMMAND DECK 

The Asari Pilot takes her hands off the controls. Her bodyslumps. The room is silent. 

ASARI CAPTAIN 
Soldier, man the controls! 


109. 

ASARI PILOT 
Captain, with all due respect, it’s 
over. 

ASARI CAPTAIN 
Not until I say it is! 

ASARI PILOT 
The enemy has control of thestation. They’ve shut down the massrelay’s! The rest of the Citadelfleet can’t even get through! We’rehelpless and stranded! 

Through the window another Citadel ship is destroyed by Gethwarships. 

ASARI CAPTAIN 
Give up, and the enemy wins. Fight,
and we might lose anyway. But atleast we take a few of them out 
with us. Now, take those controls! 

ASARI PILOT 
Yes, sir! 

The Asari Pilot grabs the controls with renewed intensity. 

INT. CITADEL TOWER 

Shepard’s team continues running up the stairs. 

One husk grab’s Liara’s wound. She screams. Ashley blasts thehusks off her. 

INT. CITADEL COUNCIL 

The team reach the top of the stairs. Behind them lay thebodies of dozens of husks. Ahead of them, up a last steepstaircase, are the Citadel master controls. 

Saren continues to manipulate the master controls. FOOTSTEPSapproach. Saren turns around. He whips a grenade at the team. 

Shepard, Ashley, and Liara take cover at the base of thestairs. The grenade EXPLODES. 

SAREN 
I was afraid you wouldn’t make itin time, Shepard. 

Saren speaks confidently and in the open. 


110. 

Shepard yells back from cover. 

SHEPARD 
In time? 

SAREN 

I think we both expected it would

end like this. You’re very

persistent. Like myself. Only

you’ve lost.

(beat)
You know that, don’t you? 

SHEPARD 
It’s not over! 

SAREN 

Oh, but it is. In a few minutes 

Sovereign will have control of all

the Citadel systems. The citadel

relay will open. The Reapers will 

return. 

SHEPARD 

I’ve still got a few tricks up my

sleeve! 

SAREN 

You survived on Virmire, but I’ve 

changed since then. Improved.

Sovereign has upgraded me. 

Saren’s eyes glow blue. 

SHEPARD 

You let Sovereign implant you? Are

you insane? 

SAREN 

I suppose I should thank you. After

Virmire I couldn’t stop thinking

about what you said. About

Sovereign manipulating me. About

indoctrination. The doubts began to

eat away at me. Sovereign sensed my

hesitation. I was implanted... to

strengthen my resolve! Now my

doubts are gone. I believe in

Sovereign completely! I understand

that the Reapers need organics.

Join us, and Sovereign will find a

place for you, too. 


111. 

SHEPARD 
Sovereign's just controlling youthrough your implants! Don’t yousee that? 

SAREN 
The relationship is symbiotic.
Organic and machine. Intertwined. Aunion of flesh and steel. The 
strengths of both, the weaknessesof neither. I am a vision of 
future! The evolution of all 
organic life! This is our destiny.
Join Sovereign and experience atrue rebirth. 

SHEPARD 
Sovereign has not won yet. I canstop it from taking control of thestation! Step aside, and theinvasion will never happen. 

SAREN 
We can’t stop it! Not forever! Yousaw the visions. You saw what 
happened to the protheans! TheReapers are too powerful. 

SHEPARD 
Some part of you must still realizethis is wrong! You can fight this! 

SAREN 
No. There’s not. Maybe... 

Saren tenses up. He GROANS and struggles to control himself. 

SAREN (CONT’D)
Maybe you’re right... 

Saren continues his internal struggle. 

SAREN (CONT’D)
Maybe there is still a chancefor... for.. 

Saren collapses onto the ground. 

SAREN (CONT’D)
The implants! Sovereign’s toostrong! I’m sorry, it is too latefor me. 


112. 

Shepard steps out from cover. He stands in the open andchallenges Saren. 

SHEPARD 
It’s not over yet! You can stillredeem yourself! 

Saren holds onto a guardrail to keep himself upright. He isstill struggling to speak freely. Saren grabs his hand gun. 
SAREN 
Goodbye, Shepard. 
Saren puts the gun to his head. 
SAREN (CONT’D) 
Thank you. 
Shepard watches in horror as a GUNSHOT goes off. 
Saren slumps to the floor. His body is finally at peace. 

ASHLEY 
Don’t just stand there! You’ve gota galaxy to save! 

SHEPARD 
Rest in peace, spectre. 

Shepard runs up the stairs. Ashley and Liara follow. 
Shepard takes out the Vigil-disc and puts it into the mastercontrol. 

The master control screens flash red. Then go black. 
ASHLEY 
Ok, so, maybe that wasn’t a good 
idea... 
LIARA 
The protheans worked too hard forthis. I trust in Vigil. 

Sparks fly. The Vigil-disc shoots back out of the Mastercontrol. It’s burnt to a crisp. 
The master control systems boots up again. It’s back online. 
Ashley gives Liara a love-punch in the shoulder. 

ASHLEY 
I knew it’d work! 


113. 

Shepard immediately goes to work at the console. 

SHEPARD 
Vigil has given us back control ofall systems! 

ASHLEY 
Quick! Open the station’s arms! Itwon’t be long before Sovereignregains control of the Citadel! 

LIARA 
See if you can open a comm channel. 

Shepard types at the master controls. 

SHEPARD

ASHLEY 
You can’t sacrifice human lives to 
save the council! Save them to 
concentrate on the Reaper about totake back control of the citadel! 
What did the council ever do for 
us? 

LIARA 
This is bigger than us. Sovereignis a threat to every organicspecies in the galaxy. 

ASHLEY 
Exactly! And we can’t throw awayreenforcements trying to save thecouncil! Hold back. Don’t come 
through the relay until the wards 
are open so we can concentrate onSovereign.

The slowly walk toward the debris. No sign of Shepard. 

Movement. From behind the debris. Something moves.

ASARI COUNCILOR (CONT’D)
We have gathered here to recognizethe enormous contributions of the 
alliance forces in the war againstSovereign and the Geth. 

SALARIAN COUNCILOR 
Many humans lost their lives in thebattle to save the Citadel. Brave 
and courageous soldiers whowillingly gave their lives, so thatwe, the Council, might live. 

TURIAN COUNCILOR 
There is no greater sacrifice, andwe share your grief over the tragicloss of so many noble men and 
women. 

ASARI COUNCILOR 
The Council also owes you a greatpersonal debt, Commander. One wecan never repay. You saved not justour lives, but the lives of 
trillions from Sovereign and theReapers. 

SALARIAN COUNCILOR 
Your heroic and selfless actions 
serve as a symbol of everythinghumanity and the Alliance standfor. 

TURIAN COUNCILOR 
And though we cannot bring backthose valiant soldiers, who gavetheir lives to save ours, we can 
honor their memories through ouractions.

Udina steps forward. 

UDINA 
Councilors, on behalf of humanityand the Alliance, we thank you forthis prestigious honor, and humbly 
accept. 

SALARIAN COUNCILOR 
We will need a list of potentialcandidates to fill humanity’s seaton the council. 

ASARI COUNCILOR 
Given all that’s happened, Shepard,
any recommendation of yours willcarry a great deal of weight. 

Shepard steps forward. 

ANDERSON 
We need someone with the courage tostand up for what he believes in.
Someone like Captain Anderson. 

UDINA 
Him? You must be joking! Andersonprefers to let his fists do thetalking! 

Anderson smiles. 

ANDERSON 
Only with you, ambassador. Onlywith you. 

UDINA 
Are you sure about this, Shepard?
The Captain’s a soldier, not apolitician.

Anderson would be perfect for thisjob.

An inspired choice. 

 

SALARIAN COUNCILOR 

The Council would welcome you with 

open arms. 

TURIAN COUNCILOR 
Should you accept. 

ANDERSON 

I’m honored. As humanity’s

representative I’ll do everything

in my power to help the council

rebuild. 

TURIAN COUNCILOR 

Sovereign's defeat marks the

beginning of a new area. For

humanity, and the Council. The

galaxy is at peace once more. 

The Councilors shake hands with Anderson. 

Shepard shakes his head. 

SHEPARD 

There is no peace, not yet.

Sovereign was just the messenger.

The rest of the Reaper fleet is

coming. Hundreds. Maybe thousands.

They’ll use other methods. And I’m

going to find a way to stop them. 

Shepard leaves the room. 

ANDERSON 

Shepard’s right. Humanity is ready

to do it’s part. United with the

rest of the Council, we have the 

strength to overcome any challenge.

When the Reapers come, we must

stand side by side! Fight against

them as one. And together, we will

drive them back into dark space! 

INT. NORMANDY COMMAND DECK 

Shepard’s team is waiting for him. 

WREX 

So, what happens to the team that

just pulled off the impossible? 

SHEPARD 
How about an encore? 

 

GARRUS 
I think you’re developing a tastefor Reapers. 

ASHLEY 
Better than the crap they serve atC-Sec. 

GARRUS 
True. But far more dangerous. 

JOKER 
Commander, we’re getting reports ofan odd signature near the Freedom’sProgress colony in the TerminusSystems. 

The team sighs. 

LIARA 
I guess I’ll be cancelling my shoreleave request. 

SHEPARD 
We’ll live to rest another day.
Joker, drop off the Council.
There’s a galaxy out there thatneeds saving. 

EXT. CITADEL 

The Normandy leaves the Citadel. 

It flies into the distance and turns into just another starin the sky.
